Here's what I've been working on in January.

[Please](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-please) is a simple assertion library for the new [Wren](https://munificent.github.io/wren/) programming language. I saw the language and thought it looked fun—I especially like the block syntax—so I wrote a small library.

The [Fake C REPL](https://github.com/EvanHahn/Fake-C-REPL) is an attempt at making a REPL for C and C++. It's a stupid hack: it builds up a program as you type, and recompiles the whole program when you hit "return". It's really more of a prototype than a finished tool.

[HumanizeDuration.js](https://github.com/EvanHahn/HumanizeDuration.js) was updated to 2.2.1, which was just bugfixes.
