Here's what I've been working on in January.

I found the new [Wren](https://munificent.github.io/wren/) programming language and wrote a couple of small libraries for it. [Please](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-please) is a simple assertion library and I also made a [3D vector](https://github.com/EvanHahn/wren-vector3d) class.

The [Fake C REPL](https://github.com/EvanHahn/Fake-C-REPL) is an attempt at making a REPL for C and C++. It's a stupid hack: it builds up a program as you type, and recompiles the whole program when you hit "return". It's really more of a prototype than a finished tool.

[HumanizeDuration.js](https://github.com/EvanHahn/HumanizeDuration.js) was updated to 2.3.0. There were some bugfixes and the "spacers" feature.

I wanted to try to write a command-line shell, so I made [Mush](https://github.com/EvanHahn/mush). It's hardly a great shell, but it was cool to learn a bit about how it works. I should have been sleeping instead of working on this, honestly.

I also signed a lease for an apartment in Chicago!
