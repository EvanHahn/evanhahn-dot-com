[John Maeda](http://www.coolhunting.com/design/interview-john-maeda.php), a graphic designer, computer scientist, and academic:

> Programming is not very complicated, it's just very boring -- it's what you can do with coding that matters more than programming itself.

An anonymous computer science classmate of mine:

> I think of art as anything created or captured by a fellow human that evokes an emotional response. Under that definition, code is art. When I see a particularly bad or overwrought design expressed in code, I have a negative response, just like I would get listening to music I don't like. On the other hand, elegant or well-thought out designs (in languages I can understand) impress me and inspire me to become better at my craft.
>
> One factor which I don't consider is the accessibility of art. Literary works written in languages other than English are art, despite me not understanding them in the same way that code can be art without the majority of the public understanding it.
>
> It also helps to have [Donald Knuth](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/index.html) [on your side](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html).

Matt Ward in ["The Poetics Of Coding"](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/05/the-poetics-of-coding/):

> Perhaps code really is a form of poetry, and the coder a new kind of poet.

[Will.I.Am](http://mashable.com/2012/08/30/will-i-am-stem-mars/), former Black Eyed Pea:

> We need to start putting other categories into the concept of art. I think people that make apps are artists. I think that people who write code for Facebook, that's the new Rolling Stones. Think about the Rolling Stones and the music groups of the past, they filled up stadiums. The Beatles filled up stadiums. If you take the Beatles' songs and called them software played on hardware, that's Facebook. Facebook is software that you play and experience on hardware. So Mark Zuckerberg, to me he ain't nothing but freakin' John Lennon. Jack Dorsey, he ain't nothing but Mick Jagger. Just a whole different level, man. Just bigger.

Ashutosh Kadakia on [codeispoetry.org](http://www.codeispoetry.org/about):

> Poetry is written in many languages. English, French, Latin, Italian, Hindi, etc, etc. Code is no different.

Twitter founder Jack Dorsey on [Code.org](http://www.code.org/):

> I think that great programming is not all that dissimilar to great art.

Harvye Mudd president Maria Klawe on [Code.org](http://www.code.org/):

> Coding is today's language of creativity. All our children deserve a chance to become creators instead consumers of computer science.

["Code Isn't Just Functional, It's Poetic"](http://www.wired.com/magazine/2013/04/code/) on Wired:

> One night in 2011, several engineers were out drinking in a Copenhagen bar. After the second or third beer, one of them boasted that he could recognize the author of a computer program based purely on the writing style. To Ishac Bertran -- an interaction designer who's studied Catalan poetry in school -- it sounded like they were discussing literature. "I realized code wasn't so different from any other language," he says. By the end of the evening, he'd proposed that his colleagues try composing poems in code. A genre was born.

[The Smithsonian added code to its collection.](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/35520989/)

A snippet from [e e cummings's "since feeling is first"](http://famouspoetsandpoems.com/poets/e__e__cummings/poems/14203):

> since feeling is first<br>
> who pays any attention<br>
> to the syntax of things<br>
> will never wholly kiss you

From ["On Poetry and Programming"](http://women2.com/poetry-programming/):

> The beginning of programming was mind-bending. I instantly fell in love with the problem solving and the practical and philosophical concerns behind its mental model. The layers of abstraction and the striving for elegance drew me in. But most of all, I was taken by its immense creative potential. To my surprise I found that writing code reminded me of writing poems. In the act of creation, you encounter the same tension of raw, boundless possibility against disciplined construction.
