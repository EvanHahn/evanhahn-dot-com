This is a giant list of projects I've worked on.

Some highlights:

- [Helmet](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet) is a module to help secure Express web applications. It was originally created by [Adam Baldwin](https://evilpacket.net/) and I've been the primary maintainer since 2013. It was downloaded [over 48 million times in 2020](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=helmet).
- [_Express.js in Action_](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?utm_source=express-in-action&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_hahn_express_4_7_16&a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7) is a book I wrote about Express and its ecosystem. It was published in April 2016—a lifetime ago—but despite some of it being a little outdated, I'm still proud of it.
- [HumanizeDuration.js](https://evanhahn.github.io/HumanizeDuration.js/) is a library that turns durations to strings. For example, it turns 361,000 milliseconds into "6 minutes, 1 second". Dozens of contributors have localized it into 43 different languages.

The rest of this page is a list that attempts to cover everything I've done. It's pretty boring but aims to be exhaustive.

## Various words

I've written many [guides, tutorials, and how-tos](/guides). Two of those got turned into books:

- [_Express.js in Action_](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?utm_source=express-in-action&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=book_hahn_express_4_7_16&a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7), a Manning book
- [_JavaScript Testing with Jasmine_](https://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028277.do), an O'Reilly book

## Jobs

I recently started a job on [Signal](https://signal.org/)'s Desktop team. So far, my most significant contribution has been work on our [encrypted group calling feature](https://signal.org/blog/group-calls/).

I had two full-time jobs before this:

- [Airtable](https://airtable.com) is a tool to organize anything. I was on the Platform team where I worked on the [API](https://airtable.com/api), [Blocks](https://airtable.com/blocks), and much more. I learned a ton about programming, prioritization, product, and puppies.

- [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/) lets developers easily accept payments. I was on the Contextual Commerce (now called [Extend](https://www.braintreepayments.com/products/braintree-extend)) team where I did a lot of Clojure and Ruby. Before that, I spent a lot of time building Braintree's SDKs. My biggest project was [Hosted Fields](https://www.braintreepayments.com/features/seamless-checkout/custom-ui), a fancy way to accept credit cards on a webpage. We even got [a patent for it](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=10565596.PN.&OS=PN/10565596&RS=PN/10565596), which I have mixed feelings about.

I've also done some part-time work for [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) with their ["Learn React" course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101), [Cooler](https://www.cooler.dev/) with their climate change API, and [Kanary](https://www.thekanary.com/) with their matching infrastructure.

Before graduating college, I had a few other part-time jobs, mostly internships:

- Counsyl, now [Myriad Women's Health](https://myriadwomenshealth.com/), aimed to give everybody "access to vital information about their bodies to help them confidently make choices about their lives". They did this by doing complicated genetic tests and presenting them to patients in accessible ways. I wrote a lot of [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and Python code for them, and even programmed a small robot! One of the coolest parts of the internship was seeing all of the people in white lab coats, something I will likely never wear. Fun fact: they were my third internship in a row that had a nearly-boundless supply of string cheese.

- [Sencha](https://www.sencha.com/) provides frameworks for building cross-platform applications. They had me working on their [Sencha Architect](https://www.sencha.com/products/architect) team. Architect describes itself as a "visual app builder", and I'd describe it as a _huge_, powerful JavaScript application that I helped to work on. I learned a bunch about [Ext JS](https://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/) and Sencha Touch, and spent a few weeks deep in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) as well.

- [UniversityNow](http://unow.com/) provided affordable, accredited online higher education. The first weeks of my internship were fixing bugs and implementing small features in [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), but then I spent the rest of the summer working on their real-time chat feature. I learned [Backbone.js](https://backbonejs.org/) and wrote a whole lot of Jasmine specs.

- Fetchnotes was a note-taking app that aims to be "your mind's best friend". Their homepage and web app got a redesign by a brilliant designer, and I coded them both up! I bumbled my way through [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/) to make it work. Soon after, a [TechCrunch story](https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/fetchnotes-launches-a-simple-cloud-based-note-taking-service-that-twitter-users-will-love/) was written and it got tens of thousands of hits! And it worked! Scary stuff. The service is no longer around.

- [Rockmelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockmelt) was [acquired by Yahoo](https://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/57166940839/) awhile after I left. While I was there, they built a social browser; a fork of Google Chrome that baked things like Facebook and Twitter right into the browser. I worked on some internal help pages. Designers gave me PNGs and I gave them their "Quick Guide"! I also did some other pages for them (such as their What's New page or some fixes on their homepage) and a lot of internal JavaScript unit tests.

## Code stuff that isn't open source

There's some code stuff that isn't open source for whatever reason. Those things include:

- [The ChiPy Mentorship Program](https://chipymentor.org/) had me as a mentor in the Fall 2017 cohort

- [Reddit's /r/dailyprogrammer challenge solutions](/random/rdailyprogrammer-solutions)

## Non-code stuff

Pretty much all of the above is code-related, but I've done a few other things here and there when I can tear myself away. They are, in no order:

- [America's DJ](https://twitter.com/americas_dj) is a Twitter bot that tweets fake DJ names pulled from US military operations
- [A very short poem called "Camera"](http://issuu.com/netspencer/docs/calliope?mode=window&pageNumber=12)

- Custom Steam icons for [Zineth](https://evanhahn.com/tape/zineth.png), [Lode Runner 2](https://evanhahn.com/tape/loderunner2.png)

And that's it! That's pretty much everything I've done.
