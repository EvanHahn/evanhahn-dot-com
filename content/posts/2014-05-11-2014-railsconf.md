From the [RailsConf 2014 keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LfmrkyP81M):

> A lot of people will gripe about "oh, ActiveRecord is too big," or something is too big, or has too many methods, or the surface area is too big, or whatever it is, right? Like...who gives a shit? Is it more readable? Is it more clear? That's the only thing that matters! What do I care whether the surface area of a method is 100 methods or it's 200 methods? I don't give a shit about that. ... When you put clarity as your #1 mission, a lot of other concerns just fall by the wayside.

I just really liked this quote.

A great talk about software development in general. I only know a little bit about Ruby and this is a great talk.
