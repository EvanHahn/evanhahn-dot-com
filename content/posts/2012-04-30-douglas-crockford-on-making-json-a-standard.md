Douglas Crockford, "discoverer" of the JSON standard, in [an interview about JSON][1]:

> If I want to be able to use this thing, I need to make it a standard. So I bought JSON.org, put up a webpage, and sort of declared, "it's a standard." That's it. That's all I did. I didn't go around trying to convince industry and government and everybody that this is what they should do, I just put up a website, basically a one-page website, and over the years, people discovered it.

And now it's huge!
