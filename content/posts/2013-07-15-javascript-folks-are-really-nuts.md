From [Why mobile web apps are slow](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/):

> In iOS world, we don't believe in garbage collectors, and we think the Android guys are nuts. I suspect that the Android guys think the iOS guys are nuts for manual memory management. But you know what the two, cutthroat opposition camps can agree about? The JavaScript folks are really nuts.

A damn good read.
