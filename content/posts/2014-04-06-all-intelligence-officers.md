From [a speech at the RSA conference](http://geer.tinho.net/geer.rsa.28ii14.txt):

> Do we, as a society, want the comfort and convenience of increasingly technologic, invisible digital integration enough to pay for those benefits with the liberties that must be given up to be protected from the downsides of that integration?

And another quote...

> All we have to go on now is the hopeful phrase "A reasonable expectation of privacy" but what is reasonable when one inch block letters can be read from orbit?

I liked this speech because it offered solutions rather than just complaining.
