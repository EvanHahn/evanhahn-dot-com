_In short: Use text-to-speech to read your writing back to you if you can't proofread it out loud._

They say that the best proofreading is not read silently, but aloud. You are more perceptive to awkward wording and grammar errors when you speak than when you read. I always like to read my essays and blog posts aloud before I submit them.

However, sometimes I'm not in my room. When I'm studying in the library, for example, I don't want to be belting my essay out to everyone.

In cases like these, you can use text-to-speech software to hear your essay through your headphones. This is an effective alternative to reading aloud!
