_In short: [I made a trippy circle-drawing thing][0] and it fits in under 1 kilobyte._

I was bored and wanted to spend only a few hours working on a jellybean-sized project, and then I figured I'd try to make jellybean-sized code. So I grabbed the page from the [JS1k contest](https://js1k.com/) and got started.

Three hours and about 1000 bytes later, I made some pretty circles. [Go give it a try!][0]

I used a lot of tricks to cram all of this stuff in under 1024 bytes:

- Most variables were globals, because that avoids the use of `var`. I wanted to have some indication of globals versus "local" variables. My convention: global variables were lowercase, local variables were uppercase.
- I used `m` as a shorthand for `Math` and `t` as a shortcut for `setTimeout`.
- I used `myDomElement.style.cssText` to do most of the styling, rather than things like `myDomElement.style.padding = '20px'`.
- I used `onclick` rather than adding event listeners.

There a bunch of other tricks, and you can see them in the [unminified source](https://github.com/EvanHahn/Circles-1K/blob/master/full.js). Enjoy!
