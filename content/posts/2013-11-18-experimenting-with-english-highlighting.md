_In short: [visit this page](https://evanhahn.github.io/English-text-highlighting/) to see the experiment._

Today, I had an idea. Let me bore you with the details of how this idea came to me:

The presenter of [a talk I was watching](http://programming.oreilly.com/2013/10/more-instantly-better-vim.html) noted that he doesn't much like syntax highlighting in his code. Personally, I _do_ like syntax highlighting. I feel like it allows me to, at a glance, see what's going on. This idea is akin to the "We Process Images and Symbols Faster than Words" in [an article of Ryan Florence's](http://ryanflorence.com/2011/case-against-coffeescript/). When I see a gray line, I immediately know it's a comment. When I see green, it's a string.

...wait, what if we had that for English? What if text was easier to read because it was color-coded?

So I [coded this up](https://evanhahn.github.io/English-text-highlighting/). It does _simple_ "syntax highlighting" for the English language, by coloring periods and commas and quotes. It dims some common words.

[Take a look at the code](https://github.com/EvanHahn/English-text-highlighting) if you'd like! It's not too pretty, but it's just an experiment. Also I'm super sorry that the code is ugly.

Let me know what you think!
