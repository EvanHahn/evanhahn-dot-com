Mahdi Yusuf's ["Fasting & Programming"](http://www.mahdiyusuf.com/post/28530166837/fasting-programming) describes programming during Ramadan:

> I have to say it is incredible how worse off you are when you aren't able to eat (or drink) and trying to do work that is involved. For example today I was in some code that I wrote literally a little over a month ago without difficultly and for the life of me I was unable to write something very similar without doing it over 6 times.

Mahdi talks about how hard coding during Ramadan is, and what he has learned from it. Perhaps my favorite nugget was "5 good hours are better than 10 bad ones."
