From [the petition](https://github.com/pakastin/open-source-flash):

> Adobe is going to stop distributing and updating Flash player and the Shockwave player. That's ok.
>
> However Flash along with its sister project Shockwave is an important piece of Internet history and killing Flash and Shockwave means future generations can't access the past. Games, experiments and websites would be forgotten.
