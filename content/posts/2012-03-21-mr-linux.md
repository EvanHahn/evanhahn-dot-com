From [a Wired article about Linus Torvalds](https://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/03/mr-linux/):

> The [office is the] kind of place where your typical suburban dad would keep his guitar collection and rock out with his buddies over a couple of beers on a Thursday night. Instead, Torvalds spends most days here -- alone -- managing what is surely the most important open-source software project in the planet.

A great article about the creator of Linux and his character. The article paints him as a no-nonsense, modest guy who is working on Linux because it's fun. All over life, you read articles and [see TED talks](https://www.ted.com/talks/larry_smith_why_you_will_fail_to_have_a_great_career.html) and hear advice that you should do what you love and your life will be fantastic -- Mr. Torvalds seems to do that quite well and be modest to boot.
