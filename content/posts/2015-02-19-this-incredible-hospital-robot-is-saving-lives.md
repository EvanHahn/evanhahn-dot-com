From [an article on Wired](https://www.wired.com/2015/02/incredible-hospital-robot-saving-lives-also-hate/):

> Maybe that's why super-intelligent robots make us uncomfortable. It's not just fear that they're dangerous or are going to steal our jobsâ€”it's envy. They're not saddled with emotions. They do everything perfectly. They roll about assuming they can woo us with cute beeps and smooth lines like "thank you." I, for one, shan't be falling for it.
