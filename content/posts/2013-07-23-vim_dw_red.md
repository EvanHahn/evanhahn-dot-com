Let it be known that I love the color red and I love Vim. I found [a colorscheme](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1659) made by Steve Cadwallader, called `dw_red`. It was a great colorscheme (read: very red).

Unfortunately, the colorscheme only worked in Gvim. That's no way to live. The terminal is important!

I did my best to match the colors to their 256-color counterparts and added them to the colorscheme. If you'd like to use it, drop it into `/colors` or install it with [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle):

```vim
Bundle 'evanhahn/dw_red.vim'
```

It should also work with Pathogen. [Grab it here!][0]

Enjoy!
