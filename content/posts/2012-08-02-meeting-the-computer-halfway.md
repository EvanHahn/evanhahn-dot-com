From [Brian Carper's fantastic blog](http://briancarper.net/blog/442/lisp-syntax-doesnt-suck):

> Programming languages are partly for human beings and partly for computers. Programming in binary machine code would be impossible to read for a human. Programming in English prose would be impossible to parse and turn into a program for a computer. So we meet the computer halfway.

I really liked this quote, and the rest of [Brian's blog](http://briancarper.net/).
