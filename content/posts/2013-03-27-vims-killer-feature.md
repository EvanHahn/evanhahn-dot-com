From ["Vim speed is not really the point"](http://wrongsideofmemphis.com/2013/03/27/vim-speed-is-not-really-the-point/):

> I am not "faster" using Vim. I do not generate noticeable more code at the end of the day. But I generate it with less effort and caring more about the quality than battling with my keyboard. I am more relaxed, more in control, focused in what matters. Caring about getting stuff done. More productive. That's Vim killer feature.
