From [The Most Important Decisions are Non-Technical](http://prog21.dadgum.com/137.html):

> While it's fun to discuss whether an application should be implemented in Ruby or Clojure, to write beautiful and succinct code, to see how far purely functional programming can be taken, these are all secondary to defining the user experience, to designing a comfortable interface, to keeping things simple and understandable, to making sure you're building something that's actually usable by the people you're designing it for. Those are more important decisions.

Or, a shorter version that appears throughout the blog:

> It's not about technology for its own sake. It's about being able to implement your own ideas.

I couldn't have said it better.
