In [a 24 Ways article][1], Chris Sealey talks about a post-active state for links, which is something I really like.

Basically, you use some JavaScript to add a CSS class to links after you click them. This, then, allows you to style these links -- for example, you can add a loading indicator.

[A demo can be seen here.][2]

Very cool subtle design idea.
