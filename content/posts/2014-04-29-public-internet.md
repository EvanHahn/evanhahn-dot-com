["To Save the Internet We Need To Own The Means Of Distribution"](http://www.ilsr.org/save-internet-means-distribution-2/), written in the wake of bad net neutrality news:

> Owning the means of distribution is a traditional function of local government. We call our roads and bridges and water and sewer pipe networks public infrastructure for a reason.

Why couldn't the Internet be public infrastructure? I don't know where I fall on this issue, but I think it's worth considering.
