I just got Steam for Mac, and it's excellent. I downloaded *Portal* for free, and installed some custom maps. Here's how it's done.

1. Download the maps. You can get them from [Portal Game Maps](http://www.portalgamemaps.com/) or [My Aperture Labs](http://myaperturelabs.com/).
2. Unzip them.
3. Find your maps directory. It should be in *Documents*, *Steam Content*, [your username], *portal*,_portal_, *maps*.
4. Put the unzipped files into this directory.
5. Start up *Portal*.
6. Go to *Options*, *Keyboard*, *Advanced*, and check "Enable developer console." Click *OK* until you're back at the main menu.
7. Press the tilde key (~) and type `map [the map's name]`.

After a bit of loading, you'll be playing a custom map! Enjoy.

Note: I did not have luck going into the "Bonus Maps" menu. If you do, great success!
