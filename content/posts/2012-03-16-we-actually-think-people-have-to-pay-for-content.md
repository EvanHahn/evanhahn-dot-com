From [a TechCrunch TV interview with Jonathan Klein][1], CEO of Getty Images:

> "We may be old-fashioned around here -- we actually think people have to pay for content. We think that content creators also need to make a living. ... Intellectual property has to be paid for."

I agree with this point, and it seems like the "old-fashioned" model especially works for business-to-business sales like Getty does. In contrast, however, it seems like consumers are paying much less for content (I pay \$0 for music and never pirate), but content creators are still finding ways to monetize (advertisements, freemium models, merch).

The interview is also ripe with other great quotes and bits of wisdom. Worth a watch!
