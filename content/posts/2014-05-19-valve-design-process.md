From [an article about Valve's design process](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3408/the_cabal_valves_design_process_.php):

> It became very clear the technology itself was only a small part of the work and integration, training, and follow-through were absolutely necessary to make the technology useful to the game. Writing the code was typically less than half the problem.

An echo of the idea that [technology by itself does not transform anything](/technology-itself-does-not-transform-anything/).
