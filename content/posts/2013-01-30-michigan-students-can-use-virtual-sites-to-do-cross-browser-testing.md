_In short: if you're at the University of Michigan, you can do cross-browser testing with [Virtual Sites](https://virtualsites.umich.edu/)._

_Disregard this post if you're not at U of M._

I'm a University of Michigan student and I sometimes need to do cross-browser testing, and I don't use Windows. The solution: Michigan offers Virtual Sites, where you can take control of a computer and test stuff out.

To do this, you'll need Microsoft's Remote Desktop Connection. If you already use Windows, you already have it. If you're on a Mac, [you'll need to download it](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/ee236407). I don't know of a Linux solution, sadly.

Once you've done that, [configure your virtual session](https://virtualsites.umich.edu/). You can see which version of IE you'll be testing on by checking the [software list](http://www.itcs.umich.edu/sites/general/software/software_list.php?sort=windows). If you've a CAEN account, you can also take control of a CAEN machine. As of this writing, the standard one has IE8 and the CAEN one has IE9.

Happy testing!
