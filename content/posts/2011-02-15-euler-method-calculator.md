I had a homework assignment about the [Euler method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method) in my [Calc 2 class](https://www.math.lsa.umich.edu/courses/116/). The assignment was rather tedious, so I wrote a C++ program that did them for me. Naturally.

It's not the most user-friendly thing in the world -- the CPP must be modified and compiled -- but if you know what you're doing, it can be useful. If you want to mess with it and make it easier to use (perhaps a JavaScript version?), go ahead!

**[Download it here.](/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/euler_method_calulator.cpp)**

In order to use it, you need to change a few configuration variables (like initial _x_ values, step sizes) and then you're off.

I hope this program helps someone -- it helped me!
