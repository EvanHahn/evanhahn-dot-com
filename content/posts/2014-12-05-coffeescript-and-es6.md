title: Thoughts on CoffeeScript after ECMAScript 6

_Note: this post is now out of date._

Back in 2012, I wrote ["I love CoffeeScript"](/i-love-coffeescript/), a short post about how I thought that CoffeeScript was a better language than JavaScript. I hadn't changed my opinion much since then; I still thought it was a great language and far more pleasant than writing JavaScript.

Then I decided to give ECMAScript 6 a try (using [6to5](https://6to5.github.io/)), and it changed the game. ES6 isn't released yet, but it's already _really_ nice to use.

It takes so many of the pain points out of JavaScript, fixing weird variable scoping, adding simpler anonymous functions with the `=>` syntax, implementing classes, adding `const`...while I don't think the next version of JavaScript will be the perfect language, I feel that ES6 modernizes the language.

ES6 obsoleted CoffeeScript for me in many ways. It took most of CoffeeScript's features like classes, array comprehensions, and default parameters. ES6 also has a bunch of _new_ features that will make for even better JavaScript. If I can use a language with all of the same features and much more, why not upgrade?

CoffeeScript still has a nicer syntax. The JavaScript semicolons flame wars will rage on, but we'll always have ugly semicolons in JavaScript. We'll still have lots of lines ending in `});`. But I'm willing to bite that bullet for the betterness of ES6.

So many of the new features seem to draw inspiration from CoffeeScript. I doubt we'd have the pleasantries of ES6 without CoffeeScript. So while I may be slowly weaning myself off of CoffeeScript, I'll still be living with its features in ES6.
