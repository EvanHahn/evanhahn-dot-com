I'd played around with [Vim][1] before this summer; the weird compiler setup for a programming class had me SSHing into their computers and using Vim while my classmates struggled with the lag of VNC. But I struggled with the editor; I spent most of my time in Insert Mode without learning any commands.

I'd always wanted to learn Vim, though. It's a lot more cross-platform (and free) than the [TextMate][2] I've used for years, and I was unsatisfied with [gedit][3] on my Ubuntu install. This summer, I vowed, would be the summer where I gave Vim a shot.

I'm on week three, and I love it. I'm still hardly fluent, but I want to be. Here's what I've learned so far:

- Vim has a _steep_ learning curve; I feel it's worth it. Vim wasn't quick for me to pick up. I spent the first week confused, spending lots of time navigating around with a sparse vocabulary. I still find myself opening [cheatsheets][4], but I'm seeing the fruits of my effort even a few weeks later.

- There are a lot of great resources online. [VIM Adventures][5] teaches you basics with a game; [VimCasts][6] is helpful for concepts like windowing and indenting; the [Vim Tips Wiki][7] is full of wisdom; [Tom Ryder][8] has [a great post about becoming a Vim user][9].

- It's hard, but you can break your old text editing habits. Don't [let yourself use the mouse][10]. [Stop the arrow keys][11] from doing anything. Avoid your old editors when you can.

- Building my own vimrc and installing plugins by hand has shown me two things: first, I have an understanding of how Vim is put together. Second, Vim is absolutely ridiculous -- it can do anything. It's very helpful to do [a GitHub search for dotfiles][12] to see what other people's configurations look like; [YADR][13] is my personal favorite so far. I don't think I would've learned as much had I copy-pasted someone else's configuration -- reading through it and cherry-picking things I like was much more educational.

Hopefully, I'll be a full-bearded Vim wizard by the end of this summer! Wish me luck.
