From [a VentureBeat article](https://venturebeat.com/2012/05/02/linkedin-ipad-app-engineering/) about LinkedIn's "95 percent" HTML5 app:

> "We did users studies in-house, and I don't think people noticed a big difference. Nobody said, 'Oh that's native,' or 'Oh, thatâ€™s web,'" said Prasad. "As long as we can make the experience fast enough, nobody can tell the difference. It still feels right."

A shining beacon of hope for the "everything is HTML" future. With a "full investment" in web technologies and avoidance of responsive design, LinkedIn nails the seemingly-native HTML5 app.
