From [John Carmack's Quake keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PhArSujR_A):

> Languages talk about being multi-paradigm as if it's a good thing, but multi-paradigm means you can always do the bad thing if you feel you really need to. And programmers are extremely bad at doing the time-scale integration of the cost of doing something that they know is negative.

This echoes a feeling I have: bells and whistles can cause problems for larger projects.
