_In short: I wrote [a tool to import Pinboard bookmarks into Standard Notes](https://evanhahn.com/tape/pinboard-to-standard-notes/)._

I care a lot about digital privacy and really appreciate the approach [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/) claims to take with my data. I started putting my bookmarks into the service instead of [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/). Pinboard is another fantastic service, but wanted to import my bookmarks into Standard Notes to have everything in one place.

So I wrote a tool to do the import! [You can use it here.](https://evanhahn.com/tape/pinboard-to-standard-notes/)

It's not a terribly complicated piece of software—it transforms some JSON data into some other JSON data—but it was useful to me and I hope it's useful to someone else out there.

The code is [open source](https://github.com/EvanHahn/import-pinboard-to-standard-notes) if you want to give it a look.
