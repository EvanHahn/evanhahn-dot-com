From [a post on a Microsoft blog](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2017/05/14/need-urgent-collective-action-keep-people-safe-online-lessons-last-weeks-cyberattack/):

> We need the tech sector, customers, and governments to work together to protect against cybersecurity attacks. More action is needed, and it's needed now. In this sense, the WannaCrypt attack is a wake-up call for all of us.
