From a _Wired_ article, ["Better Than Human"](https://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/12/ff-robots-will-take-our-jobs/all/):

> We have preconceptions about how an intelligent robot should look and act, and these can blind us to what is already happening around us. To demand that artificial intelligence be humanlike is the same flawed logic as demanding that artificial flying be birdlike, with flapping wings. Robots will think different. To see how far artificial intelligence has penetrated our lives, we need to shed the idea that they will be humanlike.
