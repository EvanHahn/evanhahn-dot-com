From [Jenn Schiffer's interview on JavaScript Jabber](http://devchat.tv/js-jabber/140-jsj-using-art-to-get-and-keep-people-interested-in-programming-with-jenn-schiffer):

> If you want people to contribute, that's ... also really important. So I can dilute my project with all these frameworks and task builders and stuff like that, but every time you add something like that, you're raising the wall that keeps the project between you and the people that you want to develop with it.

In other words, you should lower the barrier to entry as much as you can; I think this is often more valuable than having the newest tech stack.

A great interview, discussing art as an "easy gateway" into teaching programming.
