From [a _Wired_ article](https://www.wired.com/2014/08/free-mobile-data-plans-are-going-to-crush-the-startup-economy/):

> "There was a brief moment in the tech market from 1995 to now where anyone could simply attach a server to the internet and be in business," Wilson writesÂ in response to a commenter. "That moment is coming to an end."

I'm glad I grew up in a time when the Internet was kind of a "wild west"; it didn't feel ruled by corporations or governments. Sad to see it losing some of that.
