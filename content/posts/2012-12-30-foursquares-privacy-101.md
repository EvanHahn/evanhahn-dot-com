From [Foursquare's Privacy 101](https://foursquare.com/privacy/privacy101-2013):

> We want everyone to feel comfortable that their trust has been well placed, which is why we've written this description of our privacy ethos - the guiding principles that inform how we develop Foursquare and the decisions we make.

This is great and I think many websites should do something like this. It's clear, it's short, and it's helpful.
