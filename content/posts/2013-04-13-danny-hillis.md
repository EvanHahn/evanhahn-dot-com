Danny Hillis has these words to say in [his TED Talk](http://on.ted.com/DannyHillis):

> Even a modern rocket ship these days uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other. That's crazy. It was never designed to do things like that.

I think an interesting parallel can be drawn with JavaScript, too. It was hardly intended to power full applications or web servers, but that's what's happening.
