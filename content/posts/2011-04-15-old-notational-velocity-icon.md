I know I'm not the only one to use [Notational Velocity](http://notational.net/). A recent update brought a snazzy new icon. I had a "who-moved-my-cheese" moment, though, and I wanted the old icon back. So here it is for your downloading pleasure.

I've also included a Windows ICO file, if you're a fan of the icon and want to use it for something else.

- [Download for Mac (ICNS)](/uploads/nv.icns)
- [Download for Windows (ICO)](/uploads/nv.ico)
- [Download 512Ã—512 image (PNG)](/uploads/nv-512.png)

Enjoy!
