From a story about One Laptop Per Child's failure in Peru (link is now dead):

> Technology by itself does not transform anything in any sector. What tends to matter far more is the model in which the technology is used.

I agree completely. I love technology, but one can't expect better technology to magically fix things. As someone interested in computer magic, this is important to remember. I often forget it.
