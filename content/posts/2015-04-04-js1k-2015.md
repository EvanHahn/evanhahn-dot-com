For the uninitiated, [JS1k](https://js1k.com/) is a JavaScript code golfing competition. To quote its [about page](http://js1k.com/about), entrants "submit a self-contained demo in 1024 bytes of pure JS, which in turn may use various web technologies." In other words: see how much you can fit into just one kilobyte of JavaScript code.

There have been some incredible entries. [2013's winner](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1555) might be my favorite, but there are [plenty](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1384) [of](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1384) [other](https://js1k.com/2013-spring/demo/1384) [amazing](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2306) [submissions](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2364). It's almost _spooky_ to see how much one carefully crafted kilobyte of JavaScript can produce nowadays!

I've been entering since 2013, but I actually placed in the top ten this year! You can check out my submission [here](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2169). It lets you tell time using a non-traditional method: pie charts.

Many of the lessons of [Daniel LeCheminant's four-kilobyte StackOverflow clone](http://danlec.com/blog/stackoverflow-in-4096-bytes) were helpful when squeezing my entry into the byte limit. Perhaps the biggest lesson was unintuitive: repeat yourself! The [JSCrush JavaScript compressor](https://github.com/gre/jscrush) can better compress repeated code than fewer characters. That's why my code has lots of lines like this:

```javascript
canvas.c.beginPath();
canvas.c.moveTo(s / 2, s / 2);
canvas.c.arc(s / 2, s / 2, s * 0.45, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
canvas.c.stroke();
```

I could've used `with`, but that turned out to compress _worse_ than repeating myself like that. That was surprising to me!

[Give my submission a look if you'd like](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/demo/2169), but definitely [check out the other entries from this year](https://js1k.com/2015-hypetrain/)â€”there are some really cool ones.
