title: Two-factor authentication list

_In short: I made [a list of sites that support two-factor authentication](https://evanhahn.com/2fa)._

[Two-factor authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-step_verification) makes me feel a lot more secure. Barring (very possible) vulnerabilities in its workings, it's nice to know that a hacker can't log into my account with only my password.

I've enabled it in a few places, but I'd like to enable it pretty much everywhere that I can. I couldn't find a simple list of sites that supported two-factor verification, [so I made one](https://evanhahn.com/2fa).

If you'd like to add a site to the list, you can [send a pull request on GitHub](https://github.com/EvanHahn/two-factor-auth-list) or simply drop me an email at <me@evanhahn.com>. I'll love you forever.
