From ["Explicit Code is Inclusive"](https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2018/02/02/explicit-code-is-inclusive.html):

> And this is the point: fancy code is exclusionary. The cost of changing that code is higher because the pool of developers that can work on it is lower, and the cost of increasing the size of that pool is higher.

> This isn't to say that inclusivity is the only criteria we should use to examine code, but it's something we often forget, and it's pretty important. If your team plans to grow, the more programmers out there that could join your team and be successful, the easier it will be for you to grow that team. If you require deep expertise in a language or framework to be productive, you either have to filter for that in your interview process, or be prepared for a long onboarding to get new people productive.
