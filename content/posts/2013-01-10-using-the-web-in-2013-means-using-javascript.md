From [a comment by Jon Hobbs](https://css-tricks.com/rethinking-dynamic-page-replacing-content/#comment-251743):

My rule of thumb for this stuff: a content-rich site (like this one) shouldn't rely on JavaScript, where an application absolutely should. I use [Pocket](https://pocket.co), for example, and articles would be hard to parse if JavaScript did heavy lifting.

The replies to the comment are worth readingâ€”lots of different (and valid) opinions.
