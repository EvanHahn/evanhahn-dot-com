From [David Mandelin's post, "Quietly Awesome"](https://blog.mozilla.com/dmandelin/2012/04/02/quietly-awesome/):

> We have hired multiple people who didn't sparkle with enthusiasm or excitement during interviews, but turned out to be incredibly skillful, dedicated, passionate developers. What appears to be lack of enthusiasm may just be introversion.

A nice piece on introversion in software developers.
