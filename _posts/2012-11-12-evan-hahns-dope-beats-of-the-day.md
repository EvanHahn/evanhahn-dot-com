I like to think that I have an eclectic musical taste, but who knows. I _know_ that I love dope beats.

Because of my dope beats passion, I have started [Evan Hahn's Dope Beats of the Day](http://www.evanhahn.com/dbotd). For the past three weeks, I've been selecting a dope beat -- [dubstep](http://www.evanhahn.com/dbotd/?d=2012-10-31), [mashups](http://www.evanhahn.com/dbotd/?d=2012-11-11), [rap](http://www.evanhahn.com/dbotd/?d=2012-11-08), and more. These are beats that I can't get out of my head, so I thought I'd share them with the world.

Update: I did 100 dope beats and now I'm all done. Thanks for listening, everyone.
