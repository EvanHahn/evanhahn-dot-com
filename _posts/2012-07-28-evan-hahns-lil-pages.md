*In short: I made [some lil' tools][1] you can use, like a [Markdown parser][2].*

I've had some ideas kicking around for tiny webpages that accomplish a single, simple task. A Markdown parser; a "what does this hex color look like?" page; a line break remover.

So I built them! Go take a look at [Evan Hahn's lil' pages][1].

There's an [HTML tag stripper][3], a [Markdown parser][2], a [page to play with Backbone.js in the console][4], and more. I will likely add more as time goes on.

As far as the technical implementation went, I have a few remarks. First, I made these for myself, so I didn't worry about weird browser compatibility issues. Second, these aren't particularly polished -- the JavaScript code isn't stunning and [I probably could've done without jQuery][5]. Third, I used PHP to spit out the pages (there's a little server-side templating), and I have no excuse for that.
