**Update: This doesn't work on newer versions of iOS.**

Sometimes, I want to hear a song on YouTube while doing other stuff on my iPhone. After a bit of poking around, I figured out how to do it:

1.  Start the video playing.
2.  Hit the Home button to return to the home screen.
3.  Double-tap the Home button to bring up the multitasking tray.
4.  Swipe to the left and hit the Play button.

Bam.
