Web designer [Elliot Jay Stocks](http://elliotjaystocks.com/) has a beautifully designed website, but I was actually brought to his site because I heard about his CSS. Because his CSS is beautiful.

[This beautiful CSS file](http://elliotjaystocks.com/theme/4fa2d7e4dabe9d25f5004a6f/stylesheets/style.css) is full of great things. There are nine sections, all cleverly indented in a way I've never seen. Each well-commented section has a clear heading, each with clear CSS that uses a bunch of upcoming CSS features I'd never heard of. It's even got a table of contents!

I can't imagine what his [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) code might look like.

[Go take a look at the whole file.](http://elliotjaystocks.com/theme/4fa2d7e4dabe9d25f5004a6f/stylesheets/style.css) It's...it's beautiful.
