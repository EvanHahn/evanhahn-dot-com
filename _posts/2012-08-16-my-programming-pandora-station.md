*In short: I made a [Pandora station for programming][1] and I've been tweaking it since 2009.*

There's a certain kind of music that I like to listen to while I'm writing code. It's mostly instrumental, fairly mellow (but not *too* mellow), and with a steady beat. Most importantly, it's not distracting.

I've been tweaking a Pandora station called "Programming" since February of 2009, and I must say that I'm pretty happy with it. If you'd like to give it a try, [go and give it a listen][1].

I hope you enjoy!
