A couple of assignments in my 3rd semester had me producing things that I think the web might be able to use. Here they are:

* [EvanSpec][1], a unit testing thinger for C++ that aims to be really simple. One `#include` and a bunch of functions in a `main()` &mdash; that's it. Hardly robust, but perhaps useful.

* [Physics 240 final formulas sheet][2] &mdash; My E&amp;M physics class allowed two pages of formulas for the final. I crammed a bunch of stuff onto these two pages. Look it over, though, and make sure I didn't miss anything!
