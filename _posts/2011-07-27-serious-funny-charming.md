*In short: I am charmed by things that are part laughable, part serious.*

Whenever the theme from *Shaft* comes over my stereo, I smile. On one hand, it's a bit dated and somewhat laughable. On another hand, it's truly a great song. It's one part funny, one part awesome. I love this combination.

Another example is the character of Ron Burgundy. On one hand, everything he says is hilarious and unexpected. On another hand, everything he says is just a little bit epic. "By the beard of Zeus" is not an exclamation I could hear with a straight face, but I must admit that there's a hint of epic seriousness somewhere in there.

I am charmed by this fusion: one part funny, one part awesome.
