During my 5th semester, I produced some things that people might be able to use. Note that nothing here is guaranteed to be correct, though any inaccuracies are unintentional.

# Introduction to Statistics and Data Analysis (Stats 250)

* [Incomplete exam 1 study guide](http://evanhahn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/Stats250exam1studyguide.html) - I started this with a friend of mine but we didn't finish it.

# Data Structures and Algorithms (EECS 281)

* [Exam 1 study guide](http://evanhahn.com/?page_id=1408) - covers complexity (big-Oh notation and the like), some sorting algorithms, some C++ STL containers, searches
* A number of my classmates and I worked on a [final exam study guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yckyobmm251vll-lKJrNAba8SYnBCcKPSxU27QCh3-Q/edit), which was pretty sweet.
* To study algorithms, I implemented some of them in CoffeeScript.
   * [Bubble sort](https://gist.github.com/3855313)
   * [Selection sort](https://gist.github.com/3869977)
   * [Merge sort](https://gist.github.com/3870128)
   * [Quicksort](https://gist.github.com/3874172)
* I wrote a number of [utility functions](https://gist.github.com/4366909) in C++ that I used in some projects, which you might be able to use. Most of them deal with strings (`split` and `trim`, for example).

# Introduction to Computer Organization (EECS 370)

* EECS 370 had me writing a few projects with LC-2K, a fake assembly language. I [made a list of some little tricks](http://evanhahn.com/?page_id=1330) you can do with LC-2K.
* EECS 370's projects are mostly in C, and I found ["Essential C"](http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/EssentialC.pdf), a document put out by Stanford, to be incredibly helpful. Not a resource I made, but one that I found incredibly useful.
* I made a ["stuff to study" for the first exam](http://evanhahn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EECS_370_exam_1.txt). Not exactly a study guide, but might be useful.
* My friends and I made [a study guide for the second exam](http://evanhahn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/EECS-370-exam-2-study-guide.txt), which was actually pretty sweet.
* The whole class worked on [a collaborative study guide for the final exam](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NPRMsU-5pi0gF0q5MXDzUwK-MUiexzRXgiafZITxU2w/edit) -- it even was endorsed by the professor!
* I made [a lil' page that converts between binary, hex, and decimal](http://evanhahn.com/tape/lil/base_convert.php).
* I made [another lil' page that does a bitwise nand](http://evanhahn.com/tape/lil/bitwise_nand.php) of two numbers.
