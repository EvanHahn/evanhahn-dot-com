From ["Wearable Tech or Technical Wear"](http://itsmeolivia.com/post/91266643145/wearable-tech-or-technical-wear):

> I'm excited for the Glass-Luxottica joint task force. It's a step away from futuristic looking wearable tech and a step towards technological wearbles for which I would dish out that dolla. If wearables are designed to be seamlessly and beautifully integrated into everyday life with all of the consumer base in mind—yes, even the omniscient white male—then I believe Wired's prediction that wearable tech being as big as the smartphone could come true.

I agree; wearables are currently being made for nerds, not for fashionable people.
