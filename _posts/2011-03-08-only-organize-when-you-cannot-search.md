*In short: Only organize your notes/emails/todos/files when search is not enough.*

My life, like everyone's, is full of concepts to remember, tasks to complete, and projects to manage. My emails, tasks, and notes have been powerfully organized with tags, sub-tags, sub-sub-sub-tags, and worse. Because of this rabid digital organization, Iâ€™ve never missed a deadline; I hardly procrastinate; I never lose a single note.

While my organization is definitely helpful, my reliance on it as the exclusive tool for success is a mistake. I am working hard on organizing and less on "deeper" work.

I recently purged a good deal of this organization in favor of simplicity. My new philosophy: organize what search cannot find, and nothing else.

For example, I stopped tagging all of my passwords with the "Passwords" tag. When I want to find my password for something, I can simply search for it and find it. However, I continue to tag my ideas, because I often like to browse those without looking for a particular idea. Search cannot help me browse my ideas; it can help me find my passwords.

This makes me have to remember *far *less about the confusing organization and focus more on the content.
