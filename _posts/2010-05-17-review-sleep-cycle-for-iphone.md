Sleep Cycle for iPhone advertises itself as a "bio-alarm clock that analyzes your sleep patterns and wakes you when you are in the lightest sleep phase." But does it?

*In short: I found that Sleep Cycle makes for a more pleasant wakeup, and at the very least, doesn't make waking up any worse.*

# Is it a bunch of nonsense?

*In short: Not as far as I can tell.*

When I first got Sleep Cycle, I was skeptical. How could your iPhone's accelerometer give you detailed analyses of your sleep? I was nervous that it was just nonsense.

But it wasn't, at least entirely. There was a night in which I woke up at 4am, and Sleep Cycle told me that I was awake then. So it's not making the graphs up like I thought it might.

And after reading <a title="Why We Sleep, Scientific American" href="http://www.semel.ucla.edu/sleepresearch/sciam2003/sciamsleep.pdf" target="_blank">an article in <em>Scientific American</em></a>, it seemed like it could be true. While Sleep Cycle's analyses of your sleep might not be as accurate as science can get, the accelerometer can do a pretty good job.

So, as far as I can tell, it's not a bunch of nonsense.

# How well does it work?

*In short: Pretty well; it's at least better than a "normal" alarm clock. The statistics are also cool.*

Sleep Cycle wakes you up when you are nearly awake, and will wake you up 15 minutes early if you're in a light sleep then. It does a pretty good job, and I noticed myself having easier mornings.

The only time Sleep Cycle "fails" is if you are in deep sleep before waking up and it can't wake you up nicely. My initial reaction was negative, but then I remembered that a "normal" alarm clock would do that pretty much every time. Basically, it can't be any worse than the typical alarm clock.

Sleep Cycle comes with a bunch of pleasant "alarms". Their names describe them well: "Warm breeze", or "Morning mist", or "Nightingale". They're quite nice to wake up to. They don't allow you to listen to your own music, but I've found that it's better to wake up to pleasant piano arpeggios than <a title="You Give Love a Bad Name" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrZHPOeOxQQ" target="_blank">Bon Jovi's "You Give Love a Bad Name"</a>.

The app also gives you detailed graphs (shown in the picture) of your sleep, as well as averages and total sleeping time. It's the kind of thing that could make you get more sleep so that you can improve your average and brag to your friends.

# Why wouldn't you use it?

*In short: If you don't have enough space in your bed. If you can't run the charger under your bed. If you have an iPod Touch.*

I've got a twin bed and it becomes even smaller when my iPhone is sitting in the bed with me. It'd be nicer if I had a bigger bed.

I can also imagine that it'd be annoying to get your cable running nicely into your bed. I had no problem with it, but because iPhone charger cables are so short, it might be troublesome. I can imagine spending more money on an extension cord than this app.

DON'T get this app if you have an iPod Touch. <a title="Don't use an iPod Touch!" href="http://www.lexwarelabs.com/Sleep Cycle/support/" target="_blank">The company explains</a> that they do not support the iPod Touch.

You also wouldn't use it if you're not willing to drop 99 cents or don't trust my review.

# What's the verdict?

Get it. It's only 99 cents to wake up better. [Grab it from the App Store.](http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=320606217)
