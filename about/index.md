<img src="//evanhahn.com/wp-content/themes/v4/mustache-small.jpg" style="float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;" />Hi. I'm Evan Hahn. I like web programming and Sriracha sauce. That is not a real mustache.

I'm from the fine town of Palo Alto, California, and I'm currently in my fourth year of [computer science at the University of Michigan][1]. I used to tell people that I was from New Zealand (I had a pretty good fake accent) but I've since stopped doing that.

If you'd like, take a look at [my projects][2] to get a better idea of the kind of things I've made. I'm probably most proud of [the book I published on O'Reilly][3] -- I think I might be the first published author who is also illiterate.

I'm confident with JavaScript (with [jQuery][4]/[Zepto][5], [Backbone][6], [Ember][7], [Node][8], and [Jasmine][9]), [CoffeeScript][10], HTML, and CSS (with [LESS][11], [SCSS][12], [Stylus][13]). I've also done about three years of C++ and PHP and I've taken a couple of classes with Java. I'm familiar with Ruby (with Rails), WordPress, [ChucK][14]...and I've written [a little Go][15].

To conclude, some random facts: I don't like chocolate. Red is my favorite color. I love funk music.

Hit me up on [email][16], [Twitter][17] or [GitHub][18].
