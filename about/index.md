Hi. I'm Evan Hahn. I like web programming and Sriracha sauce.

I'm from the fine town of Palo Alto, California, and I just graduated with a degree in [computer science from the University of Michigan](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/). I used to tell people that I was from New Zealand (I had a pretty good fake accent) but I've since stopped doing that.

If you'd like, take a look at [my projects](/projects) to get a better idea of the kind of things I've made. Spoilers: it's mostly JavaScript, with [a book about Express.js](http://manning.com/hahn/?a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7) or various open-source libraries. I know JavaScript and the web stack best, but I've been able to embarrass myself in other things too.

To conclude, some random facts: I don't like chocolate. Red is my favorite color. I love funk music.

Hit me up on [email](mailto:me@evanhahn.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvanHahn) or [GitHub](https://github.com/EvanHahn).
