I'm Evan Hahn.

- I'm a software developer currently working at [Airtable](https://airtable.com/).
- I maintain [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), a set of middleware for securing Express.js web applications.
- I've written [a book about Express.js](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?a_bid=fe3fcff7&a_aid=express-in-action), a Node.js web framework.
- I live in a haunted mansion.

If you'd like, take a look at [my projects](/projects) to get a better idea of the kind of things I've made. I know JavaScript and the web stack best, but I've been able to embarrass myself in other things too.
