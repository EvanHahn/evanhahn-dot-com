I'm Evan Hahn, and my entire existence can be distilled down into four bullet points.

* I am a software developer at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/).
* I have a Computer Science degree from the [University of Michigan](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/).
* I am writing [a programming book about Express.js](http://manning.com/hahn/?a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7).
* I try to wear wacky socks as much as possible.

If you'd like, take a look at [my projects](/projects) to get a better idea of the kind of things I've made. Spoilers: it's mostly JavaScript, with [a book about Express.js](http://manning.com/hahn/?a_aid=express-in-action&a_bid=fe3fcff7) or various open-source libraries. I know JavaScript and the web stack best, but I've been able to embarrass myself in other things too.
