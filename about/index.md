I'm Evan Hahn.

- I'm a software developer. I'm taking a sweet month off before starting my next gig but was most recently at [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com/).
- I have a Computer Science degree from the [University of Michigan](http://www.eecs.umich.edu/cse/).
- I maintain [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/), a set of middleware for securing Express.js web applications.
- I've written [a book about Express.js](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?a_bid=fe3fcff7&a_aid=express-in-action), a Node.js web framework.
- I try to wear wacky socks as much as possible.

If you'd like, take a look at [my projects](/projects) to get a better idea of the kind of things I've made. I know JavaScript and the web stack best, but I've been able to embarrass myself in other things too.
