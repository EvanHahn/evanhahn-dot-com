I feel like I should be putting my ideas out there for people to see, so here this is. Many of these are probably stupid. Enjoy.

That means that you can use these ideas however you want as long as you (1) give me credit (2) don't make money (3) share your work under the same license. I'm willing to wave these restrictions if you want. Pop me an email at [&#109;&#x65;&#64;&#x65;&#118;&#x61;n&#104;&#x61;&#104;&#x6e;&#46;&#x63;o&#109;][2] and we can work something out.

# Actual ideas

*   Open-source all school software. University of Michigan has CTools, my high school had InClass. Make an open-source, easily deployed course thing for teachers, students, and administrators. Do things like student registration, class registration, uploading of course documents/assignments/online tests, chat rooms for classes, etc. Note: This particular idea is licensed under the [CC-BY-NC license][3].

*   Blog post: "how to encrypt everything and make yourself safe". A nicer version of [Encrypt Everything][4]. Made for people who don't know much about computers. Note: This particular idea is licensed under the [CC-BY-NC license][3].

*   Code bounty. I don't need a freelancer to spend weeks on this project -- I need *one function* written. [Bounty for Code][5] is pretty close to this but isn't active.

*   A programming video game. You control robots with instructions, not with keyboard movements. In theory, you could design a robot that's 100% automated that just wins the game (although you'd probably try to stop that in practice). Maybe you can upgrade your processor, or RAM, or other things.

*   Bash alias for DuckDuckGo. `duck !w Internet`.

*   [English syntax highlighting][6]

*   Instead of LESS (a better CSS) or CoffeeScript (a better JavaScript)...a better HTML/CSS/JS suite. Done by [Elm][7].

*   Ouija board for YouTube

*   Programmatically figure out urinal order. Men choose urinals based on a specific set of urinals. For example, if the urinal occupancy is 00000, then you occupy the final one to make it 00001. Then the next person occupies the opposite side, for 10001. Then 10101. Then 11101. Then 11111.

*   Twitmosphere: Geotagged tweets with pictures and audio and stuff. Get an actual feel for what it's like to be in a certain place.

*   One-page wiki (kinda already exists with [EtherPad][8] derivatives)

*   Minecraft Nether racing. Race to the Nether.

*   Mac: simple menu bar audio recording app

*   Brevity blog: a blog about being concise

*   Open-source Siri

*   Twitter, but private for your own thoughts

*   Blog post: how to sit on your ass and donate money. Things like SearchKindly, GoodSearch, FreeRice, The Hunger Site, Care2Click. iPhone: Extraordinaires, CauseWorld.

*   Caps lock enable/disable like you do bold and italics

*   Gamify real-life achievements

*   Idea in, idea out: every day, get shown an idea/memory

*   Make a GUI for Mupen64Plus

*   Markdown to GameFAQs converter

*   Interactive diary - Like Eliza the digital therapist

*   App of some kind that mutes commercials

*   Character counter for Gmail. Chrome extension or something.

*   "Would you do this day again?" Figures out your favorite day of the week and other stuff.

*   Collaborative playlists

*   Games website that gets you unstuck, rather than walkthroughs

*   FPS game (probably mobile) that has this premise: spawn in a multiplayer deathmatch in 10 seconds.

*   Pingaling - menubar/taskbar app that just runs pings and turns red when your network is down

*   "I want crowdsourcing." A website where you post "I want lots of people to work on this" maybe there's just one weekly one?

*   TextExpander/AutoCorrect for Chrome

*   Checkins that are more in depth. Location, on a bus, watching this movie, playing this game, riding this amusement park ride, in this class.

*   Chrome .pls player (for Chrome OS)

*   A C++ compiler that yells at you when you do something wrong. "Wow, you're an idiot. Line 273 clearly has this dumb-fuck error. I'm not even going to tell you what it is. It's embarrassing."

*   Problem: Some people have need for lots of disk space, processor power, and internet speed/bandwidth. Others use fractions of their capacity. Solution: In effect, a voluntary botnet that distributes your needs and helps out others.

*   SleepNudge - App that reminds you to go to sleep at a certain time. Not a great idea -- reminder apps and some alarm clock apps already do this.

*   Mobile app typer - Sometimes, OCR isn't good enough and you want to type something yourself. This app would show a snapshot of the image you were trying to write down and then have a keyboard below it.

*   Never Smash Alone - A website to find buddies for Super Smash Bros.

*   IdeaWiki

*   Movable wall outlets - it'd be like a sliding block puzzle, but on the whole wall.

*   Relative weather - "The weather is hotter than yesterday."

*   Awesome Creative Commons - Blog that showcases cool CC stuff

*   EmuLinux - Linux for emulating video games. Everything but emulators is stripped out. UI is changed to make emulation easiest. [RetroArch][9] sorta does this.

*   Manage IOUs on Facebook

*   Anonbook - Facebook but completely anonymous and no login

*   Crowdsourced summarizer - Full text is given or linked to. Users write summaries. Summaries are organized by word count and vote totals. Work with GreatSummary and that Yahoo keyword finder. Similar to Wikipedia in that articles are linked to by words, but automatically. Should allow limited formatting. Tables must be sortable by Javascript. Should apply to books, websites, more.

*   "Compile" pleasant UI into Wolfram|Alpha

*   Strip HTML to Markdown

*   Three-sentence wiki - Like Wikipedia but for "I just want a cursory understanding"

*   Make a Vim Syntastic thing that uses UglifyJS (or a fast compiler that checks errors) instead of compilers that take a long time, like the defaults

# Problems that need solving

*   Content consumption is good on touchscreens, but creation is lacking. How could you make it good? What kind of interface would you create?

*   Open source projects often have a lot of potential, but lack marketing and polish. A (for-profit?) thing to help make those freely available and also marketed and polished.

*   How can you represent time in ways other than numbers?

*   Reverse dictionary. You know the definition but not the word.
