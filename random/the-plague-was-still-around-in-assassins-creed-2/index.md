The plague was still around in this time, and while [it didn't strike in this game's years][1], it struck in neighboring decades. For an idea of the sentiment surrounding this, one can [read the chronicles of Agnolo di Tura][2]:

> It seemed to almost everyone that one became stupefied by seeing the pain. And it is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful thing. Indeed one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed. ... There was no one who wept for any death, for all awaited death.

Di Tura writes further that "80,000 persons died". This was written about events 100 years prior in Siena; this was close enough to the events of the game.

Plague doctors [were also still around][3] nearby.
