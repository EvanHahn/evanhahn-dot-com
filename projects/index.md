This is just a giant, ugly list of stuff I've worked on. *You* aren't ugly. You look nice. I'm sure you attract many people of every sex.

# Open-source stuff

A lot of stuff I've done has been open source. Some of it is duplicated below in later sections, but everything below is open source stuff.

## JavaScript (browser and Node)

*   [backbone-getnset][1] adds custom getters and setters to Backbone.js models
*   [BrowserIs][2] asks questions about Node.js requests useragents. Made for Express
*   [Canvas to favicon][3] sends a 16x16 &lt;canvas&gt; to the favicon
*   [Circles 1K][4] is 639 bytes of trippy and was an entry to [JS1k][5]
*   [connect-appcache][6] adds Appcache middleware to Connect/Express
*   [cyborg.txt][7] is a collection of robots.txt utilities for Node
*   ["Droplets"][8] is a little webpage for drawing waterfall-like drawings
*   [dw_red.vim][9]
*   [Flood][10] is a game I didn't invent but did implement. A friend didn't like the version she was playing, so I made one that she liked
*   [Fudo][11] is an adorable friend that was made from scratch in 36 hours at a hackathon. Art by [Lulu Tang][12]. Sound and code help from [David Jackson][13]
*   [Gopher Node][14] lets you write Gopher servers with Node
*   [Gribbagrab][15] is an asynchronous JavaScript and CSS loader that's meant to be inlined
*   [Humanize Duration][16] turns milliseconds into English durations, or many other languages
*   [JSTypes][17] is a small JavaScript library that deals with variable types
*   [MiniClass][18] is yet another JavaScript library that allows for simple classical OO. It's tiny
*   [nimi mute][19], a dictionary for the [Toki Pona][20] language
*   [Origin][21] won 7th place in the [2013 js13kgames][22]. I also [wrote a little blog post][23] about it
*   [QR It][24] turns text into QR
*   [ScriptInclude][25] adds `include` to browser-based JavaScript and is tiny
*   [SnackWrap][26] allows you to watch files and run a shell command every time a file changes. Not as focused as [Grunt][27] or [Sprockets][28]
*   [startInterval][29] is like JavaScript's `setInterval` but it starts immediately. It was made for [a guide][30]
*   [Truth table generator][31] for CoffeeScript. Made to take the tedium out of a homework assignment
*   [The TypeScript Grunt skeleton][32]
*   [Try LiScript][33]
*   [ZoomContext][34] lets you pan and zoom around an HTML5 canvas

## Everything else

*   [EvanSpec][35] is a souped-up `assert` for C++
*   [Hide the Facebook news feed][36]
*   [JSCPP][37], a shoddy attempt to port some of JavaScript's standard library to C++
*   [My dotfiles][38]
*   [Two-factor authentication list][39]
*   [VimL syntax highlighting for Atom][40]

# Words

*   [A number of guides][41]
*   [*JavaScript Testing with Jasmine*][42], an O'Reilly book

# Real stuff you can use

Some of this stuff is duplicated above.

*   [Circles 1K][4] is 639 bytes of trippy and was an entry to [JS1k][5]
*   ["Droplets"][8] is a little webpage for drawing waterfall-like drawings
*   [dw_red.vim][9]
*   ["Evan Hahn's lil' pages"][43], a collection of little web-based utilities
*   [Flood][10] is a game I didn't invent but did implement. A friend didn't like the version she was playing, so I made one that she liked
*   [Fudo][11] is an adorable friend that was made from scratch in 36 hours at a hackathon. Art by [Lulu Tang][12]. Sound and code help from [David Jackson][13]
*   [Origin][21] won 7th place in the [2013 js13kgames][22]. I also [wrote a little blog post][23] about it
*   [Pocket restyling][44] for the Stylebot Chrome extension
*   [QR It][24] turns text into QR
*   [Try LiScript][33]
*   [Two-factor authentication list][39]
*   [Write-o][45], my take on web-based distraction-free writing

# Job stuff

*   [Sencha][46] had me working on the [Sencha Architect][47] team. Architect describes itself as a "visual app builder", and I'd describe it as a *huge*, powerful JavaScript application that I helped to work on. I learned a bunch about [Sencha Touch][48] and [Ext JS][49], and spent a few weeks deep in [Node][50] as well. Fun fact: they were my second internship in a row that had a nearly-boundless supply of string cheese.

*   [UniversityNow][51] had me fixing bugs and implementing small features for the first few weeks of my internship, but then I spent the rest of the summer working on their real-time chat feature. I learned [Backbone.js][52] and wrote a whole lot of Jasmine specs. If you'd like, [I wrote a longer post about my time there][53].

*   [Fetchnotes][54]'s homepage and web app got a redesign by a brilliant designer, and I coded them both up! I bumbled my way through [Ember.js][55] to make it work. Soon after, a [TechCrunch story][56] was written and it got tens of thousands of hits! And it worked! Scary stuff. It's somewhat different now, but a lot of my code is still there.

*   [RockMelt][57]'s Quick Guide was assigned to me when I worked there (I suppose [they're Yahoo now][58]). They gave me a PNG and I gave them their Quick Guide! I also did some other pages for them (such as their What's New page or some fixes on their homepage) and a lot of internal JavaScript unit tests.

*   [Meme.js][59] is a canvas-based meme generator I worked on for [Buddy Meme][60]. They put a horrible picture of me on [their About page][61] without asking, which I thought was appropriate.

*   [*The Paly Voice*][62] is the online journalism hub for [Palo Alto High School][63]. I was the webmaster of the *Voice* for over two years and an editor-in-chief for one. It's almost completely different now, but it's still my baby. While I was coding this in high school, I learned a lot of JavaScript and jQuery and PHP and mySQL.

# Non-code stuff

*   [A very short poem called "Camera"][64]
*   [A wallpaper from a NASA photo][65]
*   [Evan Hahn's 100 dope beats of the day][66]
*   [How many English words are alphabetical?][67]
*   ["Is it worth cheating Caltrain?"][68]
*   [My ideas][69]
*   [Naps and their effectiveness][70]
*   Study guides from Michigan: [semester 3][71], [semester 4][72], [semester 5][73], and [semester 6][74]

# Misc.

*   [Caesar shift in JavaScript and CoffeeScript][75]
*   [Euler Method calculator in C++][76]
*   [Facebook autopoker Chrome extension][77] ([or the source][78])
*   [JavaScript/CoffeeScript sleepsort][79]
*   [My open source contributions][80]
*   [My StackOverflow profile][81]
*   [nimi mute][19], a dictionary for the [Toki Pona][20] language
*   [Reddit's dailyprogrammer challenge solutions][82]
*   [Tic Tac Toe in Lua][83]
*   [What if English had syntax highlighting?][84]
