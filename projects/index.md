This is just a giant, ugly list of stuff I've worked on. *You* aren't ugly. You look nice. I'm sure you attract many people of every sex.

Open-source stuff
=================

A lot of stuff I've done has been open source. Some of it is duplicated below in later sections, but everything below is open source stuff.

JavaScript (browser and Node)
-----------------------------

Job stuff
=========

* [Sencha](http://www.sencha.com/) had me working on the [Sencha Architect](http://www.sencha.com/products/architect) team. Architect describes itself as a "visual app builder", and I'd describe it as a _huge_, powerful JavaScript application that I helped to work on. I learned a bunch about [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) and [Ext JS](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/), and spent a few weeks deep in [Node](http://nodejs.org/) as well. Fun fact: they were my second internship in a row that had a nearly-boundless supply of string cheese.

* [UniversityNow](http://unow.com/) had me fixing bugs and implementing small features for the first few weeks of my internship, but then I spent the rest of the summer working on their real-time chat feature. I learned [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org/) and wrote a whole lot of Jasmine specs. If you'd like, [I wrote a longer post about my time there](/on-my-internship-at-universitynow).

* [Fetchnotes](http://www.fetchnotes.com)'s homepage and web app got a redesign by a brilliant designer, and I coded them both up! I bumbled my way through [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) to make it work. Soon after, a [TechCrunch story](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/fetchnotes-launches-a-simple-cloud-based-note-taking-service-that-twitter-users-will-love/) was written and it got tens of thousands of hits! And it worked! Scary stuff. It's pretty different now, but I worked on it back in the day!

* [RockMelt](http://rockmelt.com/)'s Quick Guide was assigned to me when I worked there (I suppose [they're Yahoo now](http://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/57166940839/)). They gave me a PNG and I gave them their Quick Guide! I also did some other pages for them (such as their What's New page or some fixes on their homepage) and a lot of internal JavaScript unit tests.

* [Meme.js](https://github.com/BuddyMeme/Meme.js) is a canvas-based meme generator I worked on for [Buddy Meme](http://www.buddymeme.com/). They put a horrible picture of me on [their About page](http://www.buddymeme.com/about) without asking, which I thought was appropriate.

* [_The Paly Voice_](http://palyvoice.com/) is the online journalism hub for [Palo Alto High School](http://www.paly.net/). I was the webmaster of the _Voice_ for over two years and an editor-in-chief for one. It's almost completely different now, but it's still my baby. While I was coding this in high school, I learned a lot of JavaScript and jQuery and PHP and mySQL.
