_In short: Turn on airplane mode, then send the picture as an attachment. It brings up a dialog with the file size. Then delete the message from your outbox._

The iPhone lets you do a lot of different things with photos, but it doesn’t let you see the file size of your photos. Here’s how to do it.

1. Turn off all data (Airplane mode on and wifi off). This makes sure you don’t actually send an email.
2. Pick the photo you want to see the size of and send it as an email.
3. Pick a random email address and then click Send.
4. Before it is done, it’ll bring up a dialog that asks you to choose the file size of the image. The size of the file will be shown as the bottom button.
5. Choose one of the options and delete the message from your Outbox. I don’t believe this works for smaller images, but if you’re trying to find the file size of a larger photo, this will tell you.
