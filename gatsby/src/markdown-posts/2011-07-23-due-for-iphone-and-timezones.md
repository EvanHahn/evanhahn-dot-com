Just wanted to make a quick post about how [Due for iPhone](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id390017969?mt=8) deals with timezones.

In short: it doesn't.

Story: I was in London. Set an alarm for 12pm on 23 July. On 22 July, I came back changed my phone's timezone. It was still 12pm.

There you have it!
