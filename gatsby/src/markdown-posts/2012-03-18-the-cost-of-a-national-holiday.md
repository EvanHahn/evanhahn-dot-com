From [a post on Sohaib Athar's blog][1]:

> In other words, it would take 800 people their entire lifespans to make up for the work that was not done due to today's holiday.

While I can't say I completely agree with his point (nor some of his number choices), I do think it's very cool when people extrapolate individuals' acts to a large scale, like [making a million dollars by asking for \$1 from a million people][2].
