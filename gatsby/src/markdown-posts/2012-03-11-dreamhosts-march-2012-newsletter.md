From [DreamHost's March 2012 newsletter:](http://www.dreamhost.com/newsletter/0312.html)

> I'll say it right now - Wikipedia is the world's most accurate source for information about anything, ever. It has taught me so much about the world that I even thought about donating during one of Wikipedia's pledge drives! Then I laughed at myself and closed the browser.

This is one of _many_ hilarious quotes. I love it when companies are quirky and personable. [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1075306) is excellent and this newsletter is really funny.
