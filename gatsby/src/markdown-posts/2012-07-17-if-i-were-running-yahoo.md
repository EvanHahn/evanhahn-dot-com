_In short: make stuff for non-technical people because that's their audience._

The interwebs are all excited about [Marissa Mayer becoming CEO of Yahoo](http://pressroom.yahoo.net/pr/ycorp/236553.aspx). She's a glimmer of hope and I hope she resurrects the company.

But how will she do it (if at all)? I have no idea, but I find it an interesting exercise to think about how one would. Here's how I'd do it in a very broad sense.

A preface: it's very easy (for me, anyway) to forget that nerds aren't everybody. I grew up in the computer-savvy Silicon Valley -- how could you not at least _know_ what TechCrunch is? But most people in the world _aren't_ nerds, and the winning products tend to acknowledge that fact somehow (think Wii, think iPad). It's not that there's no market for nerds, but there's a bigger (and arguably more important) market for regular people who don't know what a hard drive really is.

Nerds think of Yahoo as dead. [Alexa says](http://www.alexa.com/search?q=yahoo.com) that it's the fourth-most visited site in the United States. Still alive, I say! Maybe not many nerds use it, but it's clear that many normal people use it.

And so I think Yahoo should be building technology for those people. Make a web that regular people can use.

Some people think that Mayer's takeover will be Steve Jobsian. To make technology's innovations accessible to regular consumers would certainly be Jobsian, and I think it'd put Yahoo back on the upward slope.
