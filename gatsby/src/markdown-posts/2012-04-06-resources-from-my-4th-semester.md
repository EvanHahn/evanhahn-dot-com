A couple of assignments in my 4th semester had me producing things that I think the web might be able to use. I didn't put a ton of time into preparing some of these for the web nor can I guarantee accuracy, but:

- From Discrete Mathematics (EECS 203)...

  - [Chapter 1 summary][1] - covers basic logic stuff.
  - [English ways to express conditionals][2]
  - [Exam #1 study guide][3] - Covers propositions, operations, conditionals, quantifiers, inference, and sets.
  - [Exam #2 study guide][4] - Many of my classmates and I collaborated on this. Contains information on counting, big-O notation and the like, probability, counting, Bayes's Theorem, and more.
  - [Final exam study guide][5] - This thing was beautiful. Even my professor helped! From the Google Docs page, you can download it in any format you like (HTML, PDF, Word document, etc.).

- I made [my own personal LaTeX document][6] for doing math homework. You can adapt it for your use (eg, remove my name). ([Also available in plain text format.][7])

- [All of my notes from Math 216, differential equations][8] - disorganized and some plain text might be garbled, but mostly scanned notes that might be useful.

- I compiled [a list of quotes about emperor Tiberius][9] from the ancient Roman historians Suetonius and Tacitus. I used only a handful of these in a paper.

- I made [a study guide][10] which contains summaries of some important people/events in Roman history after the Julio-Claudian emperors.

- I attended a [Michigan Hackers talk on the Facebook API][11] and took [some notes][12] which you might find useful.

Enjoy!
