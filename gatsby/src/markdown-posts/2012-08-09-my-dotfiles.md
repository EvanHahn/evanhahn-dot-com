I finally made [a dotfiles repo](https://github.com/evanhahn/dotfiles). It's got (incomplete) installs for my OSX and my Ubuntu machines, an enormous vimrc, a bunch of bashrc things, and more.

Some _gems_:

- `..` is an alias for `cd ..`
- `pingo` does a single ping and tells you how long it took
- `git s` is for status (so is `gits`), `git d` is for diff, `git l` is for logging
- `git purr` does a pull-rebase
- `unzip` unzips most everything
- `rm` puts things in the trash, rather than destroying them
- `git all` commits everything (an alias of `git commit -a`)
- _Lots_ of Vim configurations and plugins

Enjoy! It's constantly changing because I'm constantly finding new stuff.
