I'm Evan Hahn, a programmer.

I grew up in Silicon Valley and now live in Chicago in a **haunted mansion**.

I'm currently **volunteering** for several nonprofits, including the [Sierra Club](https://www.sierraclub.org/) and [Citizens' Climate Lobby](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/). Before this, I worked for [Airtable](https://airtable.com).

I maintain several **open source** projects. [Helmet.js](https://helmetjs.github.io/) is the most popular with over 27 million downloads in 2019.

I wrote a [**book** about Express.js](https://www.manning.com/books/express-in-action?a_bid=fe3fcff7&a_aid=express-in-action), a Node.js web framework.

For more, see [my list of **projects**](/projects), or [contact me](/contact).
