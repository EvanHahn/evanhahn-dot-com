* First big moment
    * Went to Japan because Japan is modernized with Western influence
    * His preface is in many Chinese textbooks
    * Everyone around him was against Chinese people; visual image of Chinese people being savages (Chinese spectators watching some Chinese person getting executed)
    * He thought Chinese people were idiots, basically
    * Literature is the way to fix Chinese people
    * The worst thing is when you try to change the world and nobody cares
    * He's given up; wastes his time and drinks/smokes heavily

* Second big moment
    * Iron house (aka iron room)
    * People inside are all asleep and gonna suffocate
    * Should you wake them up and make them die sadly, or should you wake them up and give them a chance?
    * Something COULD happen if you wake them up
    * He decides to write short stories for New Youth

* "I've really been taught a lot of bullshit" -- Lu Xun wants to tear that out by its roots. Madness is perhaps the only way to get out of this bubble
