Chairman Mao laid out a number of standards for fiction in his famous Yan'an Talks of 1942: there were a number of rules that literature had to follow in order to serve as propaganda for the Communist Party. Non-conforming literature was to be outlawed. He Guyan's “Maple Leaves” has some explicit adherences to Mao's rules, contains many subtle pro-Communist allusions, and harbors some minor anti-Communist points. However, any ambiguity is righted: the short story is overtly supportive of the Party because of its final words. “Maple Leaves” is therefore adherent to Chairman Mao's regulations by my standards.

Chairman Mao laid out twelve rules for literature, and ten of them can be analyzed with an English translation (two of the rules involve understanding of the Chinese language that is not conveyed in an English version). I feel that the story supports Communism in its overall message and therefore adheres to Mao's “big picture” rules, but is more lax in its adherence to specific ones. The story certainly serves politics, as it is pro-Communist China (the first rule out of ten). The writer's standpoint follows soldiers (the second rule) and praises them as proletariats (third). It is also written for the people (four out of ten rules) and elevates the reader's opinion of them (fifth). Mao also forbade satire and this story is hardly satirical (the sixth point out of ten). The story also portrays Americans as antagonists (point seven). But in some specifics, the story is not as clearly adherent. While the story's ending is not entirely somber, “Maple Leaves” does not have an obviously positive ending (the eighth point); a reader could debate either side of the “is this a happy ending” argument. Hu Guyan also does not seem to touch on any form of class struggle (rule number nine), nor are there particularly distinct character groups (point ten out of ten). The narrative of “Maple Leaves” complies with Mao's broader rules but is less compliant with the more specific ones.

He Guyan alludes to a number of pro-Communist ideas throughout the story. The first sentence of the story begins as follows: “One autumn evening, as the sun was reddening in the western sky”. Autumn is certainly an allusion to the red Communist color, but if that is not explicit enough, the word “reddening” is written in there. The story also holds the motif of maple leaves, another potential allusion to the color red. Both characters enjoy a photo of Chairman Mao: “One [of the things Wang enjoyed] was a coloured picture of Chairman Mao he had bought ...  Hu liked it too”. This is obviously supportive of the man, the Chinese Communist Party, and Mao's revolution. The story follows two heroic Communist soldiers struggling against the capitalist Americans. Mao also decreed that the protagonists should be soldiers or Communists and Americans are among the enemies, so this story is adherent to that rule. The story includes a number of bits that implicitly support Communism, and while many examples of the support were not obvious conformities on He Guyan's part, they certainly supported Chairman Mao's overall message.

While the tale has some Communist ties, it also contains some questionably-Rightist elements. The story is about two individuals. It explores their characters and some of their non-Communist inner thoughts. When Wang dies, others lament the individual's absence. The portrait of only two characters is hardly the appreciation for groups that Mao wanted. Wang also refers to his home province of Jehol, and how its beauty is about to be lost with the addition of a new factory. “'It would be very good to have a line of maples round the outside of the factory,'” says Wang. While Wang is not entirely opposed to the change, he feels that there is some beauty in how his world once was; this could be interpreted as resistance to the Communist liberation. “Maple Leaves,” while supporting the Communists overall, contains a few elements that could be seen as Rightist.

There are some subtleties of the work that support Communism and other ones that oppose the movement, but there are three sentences in the penultimate paragraph that firmly assert the story as a Communist piece: “Wang had been like a single maple tree on the plains of China. Compared to the vast forests it was next to nothing, but it was just such trees that made up the forests. Although maples did not have the scent of flowers they were more beautiful than any flower on earth, particularly when the cold winds of autumn bit through to the bone after the heavy frosts had begun.” He Guyan concludes his story with a powerfully Communist (and indeed poetic) message: the work of one may seem insignificant, but it is the seemingly-insignificant parts that make up something grand. There may not be much glory in the work, but it is beautiful. Scarcely will one ever read a more Communist metaphor! While this praise is not an explicit adherence to any of Mao's specific rules, I feel that the Chairman would be pleased with “Maple Leaves” because of the short passage at the end.

“Maple Leaves” is a short story that only quietly conveys the Marxist ideology for most of the text and even contains some debatably Rightist themes, but three sentences in the final passage right any ambiguity about its support for Communism: the story is definitely a pro-Communist one. He Guyan skirts around ideas but sets the viewpoint straight at the end with a powerful passage. “Maple Leaves” is a story that supports Chairman Mao, and despite not obviously adhering to some of the rules, it is a very pro-Communist tale.
