* Indirectly leads to founding of Chinese Communist Party in 1921
* May Fourth writers were like "no more Confucianism" and other things
* There was to be a language change, influenced by "spoken Chinese, the traditional vernacular, and some lexical and syntactic elements from Western languages (often through the intermediary of Japanese)."

* "Some writers focused on reform of the Chinese writing style by using contemporary vernacular speech patterns in works of literature, thus putting an end for the inevitable elitism that accompanied the mastery of the intensely difficult classical Chinese. Some had a deep interest in traditional Western art and culture, while others looked to the avant-garde elements of that culture, such as surrealist and cubist painting, symbolist poetry, graphic design, realist drama, and new fashions in dress and interior decoration. Some sought to refuse Chinese traditional arts with a new spirit of nationalism by borrowing a selective range of Western painterly techniques. Some writers advocated a problem-solving approach, developing techniques from such disciplines as sociology, economics, history, and philosophy in order to analyze China's problems and suggest ways to address them. Others too a similarly pragmatic approach, but thought the answer was to develop a sophisticated awareness of the achievements of Western science, engineering, and medicine. ... sought to change the world swiftly by radical activism. ... some sought ... [to remove] all barriers to love and progress".
