From my reading
- Probably during 1958 Great Leap Forward when Chinese were encouraged to increase production
- Yang Tiankuan left Flood Water Valley with "a hundred kilograms of millet"
- Yang trades it for a wife with a giant goiter (neck bulge). She is known as Goiter but wants Apricot/Cao.
- She was intense. Scary. "Capable". "Hardworking". Vulgar.
- They were gross
- They had 8 kids (2 died?). All named after foods
- She sprayed her husband with her tit
- They were briefly prosperous but not for long with all those kids
- Common to best wives in this area but not Cao
- They ate mule shit
- Times were really tough -- licking the bowl clean
- Guy quotes Mao to get through to Cao who is writhing on the ground with hysteria because she lost grain coupons
- Yang beats his wife after she loses grain
- She dies
- At her funeral, they find the coupons
- Yang is sad

Characters
- Yang Tiankuan - husband of wife with big goiter. "Bought" her by carrying 100 kg of grain.
- Apricot/Cao/Goiter - intense wife of Yang Tiankuan. Evil, some say. Intense.
