- You should make art to serve the Communists
- "Three kinds of people: the enemy, the allies to the united front and our own people"
- "We ought to criticize them if they do not put up an active resistance to Japan"
- "What we produce should enable them to unite, to advance and to stride forward with one heart and one mind"
- You gotta write in the people's language; you're writing for the people
- Literature stems from life, and it's more exciting
- The political criterion for a story is more valuable than the artistic one

- Historical background
    - Truth is associated with literacy and knowledge from the past
    - Elite class of educated people, they own the government
    - The society is below them
    - Communists fled to rural areas (north), around 1930s
    - Going in and taking landlord on stage, and letting peasants come up and yell at them
    - Peasants wanted land; land distributions were important
    - The Nationalists attack. Communists use nontraditional guerrilla warfare to win with smaller numbers
    - Somehow, the Communists took over China. They promoted their ideas by teaching people and having them go to places
    - There's a literature conference in May of 1942. Mao gives the opening welcome and greeting, then there are 20 days, and then there are closing remarks. Among the most important documents about culture in China

- Mao is here is a rep for the masses

- Communists were disappointed that literature wasn't a propaganda tool

- What is said
    - If works are present-day, the problems should be solved now and by Communism
    - Eulogize/extol/praise: say good things about the workers/peasants/soldiers
    - Expose/criticize/condemn: say bad things about
    - Mao didn't say this, but you never deal with an individual's inner workings
    - It's about typical people and all of us
    - 8  years before you can be a good writer for the peasants
    - Good characters (worker/peasant/soldier/Communists) and bad characters (Nationalists/imperialists/capitalists/Americans/Japanese)
    - You have to popularize - make it for people
    - Oppressed classes vs. oppressors
    - Positive endings - if it takes place before Communists take over, it has to have an upward trend. If it's after they take over, it's gotta be happy.
    - Nothing satirical

- You're evil if you mess with a peasant's head.

- Things Professor Kaldis says are "secret codes" in the fiction
    - It's in your genes to be a good person if you're a peasant. Good people are attractive, capable, etc. Bad people are ugly.
    - Group vs. individual. Individuals are bad, groups are good
    - Narrator tells you who's good and bad
    - Speaking bitterness: cathartic, telling about all of the difficulties you've suffered in your life
    - Truth isn't associated with individual
    - They're against privacy. Personal privacy is noble. Everything is acceptable public speech.
    - The only thing that can stress a character: blood family demands versus socioeconomic family demands
    - Everywhere you go (including bedroom, kitchen, etc) is a place for Communist party ideology
    - Three main categories of villain
        - Pre-liberation villains: Nationalists, Japanese, Americans, landlords, greedy people
        - People with bloodline of pre-liberation villains (ie, his grandpa was a landlord)
        - Non-human villains (flood, famine, poverty, animals, religion, superstition)
        - Red vs. expert
        - Labor is important. Working all the time. Manual labor.
        - Women are in the kitchen. Still pretty traditional. Women in power are seen as bad.
        - Overt textual propaganda

- Communists would kill rats and sparrows and bugs
