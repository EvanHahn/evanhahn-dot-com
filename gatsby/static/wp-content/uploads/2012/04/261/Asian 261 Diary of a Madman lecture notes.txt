* Lu Xun wrote Diary of a Madman, which (to many) marks the beginning of modern Chinese fiction
* Trampling books or whatever = offending some traditionalists
* He's insane
* The madman goes and reads ancient "sacred" Confucian texts = sees "eat people"
* No real people, perhaps by intention (Chinese people don't see a real-life villain)
* Your family is the reason why you are bad

* It was shocking to readers

* Intro is in traditional Chinese language (old society), madman writes in new Chinese, vernacular (new society) and writes foreign words -- this is important
* "I've really been taught a lot of bullshit" -- Lu Xun wants to tear that out by its roots. Madness is perhaps the only way to get out of this bubble

* Lu Xun is skeptical of intellectuals -- he thought it useless to try to change China
