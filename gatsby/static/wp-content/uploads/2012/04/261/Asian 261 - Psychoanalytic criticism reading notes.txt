- Freud - "classical psychoanalytics"
- Focused on solving disorders and things

- Unconscious is where your bad emotions are and they are repressed in "repression". Has deepest control over who you are. Manifests itself in "this time, I'll win"
- Family is very important and instilled in us very early
- Sibling rivalry
- Defense = keep shit in the unconscious
    - Selective perception = only hear what we want to hear
    - Selective memory = modifying memory
    - Denial = it didn't happen
    - Avoidance = don't confront it
    - Displacement = taking it out on others

    - Low self-esteem
    - Lack of identity
    - Oedipal complex = you compete with the same-sex parent for the opposite-sex one. Manifests itself badly later in life

 - Dreams
    - Dreams have a meaning, called latent content (actual underlying meaning)
    - Manifest content = the "metaphor". Created by primary revision.
    - Dream displacement replaces something good with something bad
    - Condensation = multiple core issues manifest themselves

    - Death work, self-destructive behavior
    - Most common death work = feeling nothing

- Sex
    - Freud said sex drive = ethos
    - Penis envy = women want dicks, maybe for power
    - Castration envy = dudes don't wanna lose their dicks and therefore their power

- Superego = society's values as a part of you
- Id = primal desires
- Ego = "referee" between superego and id

- Lacan
    - Children don't have a sense of self until they reach the Mirror Stage
    - Imaginary stage = no words, just senses to interact with the world
    - Desire of the Mother = mom is most important and vice-versa
    - By learning language, you enter Symbolic Order and can give things abstract meanings (me, you, etc). People unconsciously want to go back to before they learned language. This thing is called "objet petit a". Symbolic Order also divides conscious and unconscious.
    - Metaphor is for condensation
    - Metonym = "I don't like the crown" to refer to the king. It's for displacement
    - Mom belongs to dad
    - Your desires are just because of your culture, or your Symbolic Order
    - The Real = no ideologies
