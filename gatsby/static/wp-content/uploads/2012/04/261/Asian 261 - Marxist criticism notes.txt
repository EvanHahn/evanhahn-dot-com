- Fundamental premises of Marxism
    - "For Marxism, getting and keeping economic power is the motive behind" everything
    - Economics is the base on which the superstructure of everything else is built
    - Socioeconomic class, rather than economic class
    - Material = economic
    - Historical = social/political/ideological
    - All human events and productions have specific material/historical causes
    - Marxist praxis = methodology
    - Bourgeoisie = people in power. Proletariat = not.

- Class system in America
    - In America, you should classify people HOW they live socioeconomically, rather than their income
    - There are classes: the underclass, lower, middle, upper, and aristocracy
    - The poor are oppressed for many reasons, but one of the big ones is ideology

- Role of ideology
    - Ideology = belief system. -isms, usually
    - "Marxism works to make us constantly aware of all the ways in which we are products of material/historical circumstances and of the repressive ideologies that serve to blind us"
    - Marxists agree that "the most successful ideologies are not recognized as ideologies but are thought to be natural ways of seeing the world"
    - The "American Dream" is an ideology, not a truth
    - "For Marxism, when an ideal functions to mask its own failure, it is a false ideal, or false consciousness"
    - Classism = you're a better person if you're higher class
    - Patriotism, "rugged individualism", consumerism
    - Religion. Karl Marx says it's an "opiate of the masses"

- Human behavior, the commodity, and the family
    - Alienated labor = people can become disassociated with what they're producing
    - Marx was concerned that value = money
    - "For Marxism, a commodity's value lies not in what it can do (use value) but in ... for which it can be traded (exchange value) or in the social status it confers ... (sign-exchange value)."
    - Commodification = "relating objects or persons in terms of their exchange value or sign-exchange value"
    - Conspicuous consumption = spending too much to show how much money you have
    - Imperialism = domination of another place for money
    - You can dominate the consciousness of the places you take over

- Marxism and literature
    - For some Marxists, it's all about realism. For others, non-realism is best because it's good for critiquing the world
    - Some Marxists even see capitalist stuff as good because it shows how things are messed up

- Some of the questions Marxist critics ask about literature
    - Does the work reinforce capitalism, imperialism, or classism?
    - Does it critique capitalism, imperialism, or classism?
    - Is it ideologically conflicted?
    - How does it reflect the socioeconomic conditions of the time?
    - How might the work criticize religion?

- Class struggle = classes are in antagonism with one another

- Titanic tells us that these poorer people are happier; you don't want to be like the rich people
- Love conquers all class conflict

- Patriotism = blinds you to the wrongdoing that your nation is doing. Allows the poor to be dominated
