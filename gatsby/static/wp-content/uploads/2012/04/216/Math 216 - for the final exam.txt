students need to be able to understand and draw reasonable phase plane diagrams for the nonlinear systems we study in chapter 6 (but we won't be testing them on their ability to identify what different predator/prey/etc. models look like).  In chapter 7 we _will_ provide a list of transforms for the final.  It will likely be table 7.1.2 on p.446, plus the transform of the delta function.

In the web homework for chapter 7, note that the web homework system writes the step function u(t) as step(t).
