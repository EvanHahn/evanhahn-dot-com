************

Reference appcache like so:

    <html manifest="offline.appcache">

Clean caches in chrome://appcache-internals/

"When you visit Sprite Cow, you'll instantly get the version from your cache.
Once the page has finished rendering, the browser will look for updates to the
manifest and cached files." If it has updated, it fires updateready event.

Appcache only refreshes if you make a change to the manifest (any change will
do, do it with a comment).

"Non-cached resources will not load on a cached page", even online. Get around
this with NETWORK in appcache.

"Redirects to other domains are treated as failures"

LocalStorage might be a good alternative
