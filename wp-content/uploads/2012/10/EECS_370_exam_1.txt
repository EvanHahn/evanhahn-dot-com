EECS 370 exam 1 stuff to study
==============================

by Evan Hahn and Scott Godbold

- floating point conversion
   0. convert to binary & normalize
   1. signed bit: first bit (positive or negative)
   2. exponent: next 8 bits (127 + shift amount)
   3. mantissa: remaining 23 bits (remaing values to the right of the decimal)
   
- hex conversion
  - every 4 bits = one hex digit (0-F)
  - denoted 0x<stuff>

- size of things
    * int = 4 bytes
    * short = 2 bytes
    * long = 8 bytes
    * char = 1 byte
    * Important notes:
      - item must start on a evenly divisible adress (i.e. int must start on an address divisible by 4)
      - structs must start on a multiple of their largest element (which includes containing structs)

- callee/caller registers

- static, stack, heap, text, symbol
  - text: code
  - static: globals and statics
  - stack: small variables, parameters to subroutines, local variables
  - heap: big variables, not in the stack
  - symbols: type, scope level, sometimes pointer to location
