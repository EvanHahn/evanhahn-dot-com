* Proposition = Statement that's true or false
* Propositional variable = Variable representing a proposition
* Truth value = Either true or false
* &not;p = Negation of p
* Compound proposition = Proposition constructed by combining propositions using logical operators
* p ^ q = Conjunction; AND
* p V q = Disjunction; OR
* p XOR q = Exclusive or; XOR; only one can be true
* p -&gt; q = If p then q
* Converse of p -> q = q -> p
* Contrapositive of p -> q = &not;q -> &not;p
* Inverse of p -> q = &not;p -> &not;q
* p &lt;-&gt; q = Biconditional; p if and only if q
* Bitwise operations = operations on strings of bits that operate on each bit in one string and the corresponding bit in the other string
* Tautology = Preposition that's always true
* Contradiction = Preposition that's always false
* Contingency = Not a tautology nor contradiction

* &forall; = all of x in domain is true
* &exist; = at least one x in domain is true</pre>
