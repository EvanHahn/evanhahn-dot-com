Notes
- "Spineless father"
- Some dude insults their town (called Bean Hamlet) and Cassia gets pissed, but then realizes that a "deputy work-team leader" shouldn't lose her temper
- She's on "comrade" terms with a young boy
- Didn't tell people about how Bean Hamlet beat the flood; wanted to appear tough
- Big Wu comes in on a sweet horse
- Husband Waizi is coming back and that's bad news
- Her husband wanted to abandon the group when times were bad, and do good for him and his family: he's a dick

Notes from class
- It's a Great Leap Forward story
- Without the greedy/lazy person, you band together and things work out well for you
- Mother-in-law and daughter-in-law are traditionally enemies but they're fine in this story
- Images of plenty
- Big Wu and Cassia have sexual tension
