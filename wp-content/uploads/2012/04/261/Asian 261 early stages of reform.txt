Big picture: lots of stuff happened to make China realize that they needed to modernize.

* China was being "cut up like a melon" but there was a push against modernization

* Japan was doing some serious modernization and militarization unbeknownst to China
* They both wanted control of Korea and had a naval battle in 1895
* China lost, Treaty of Simonoseki gave up Taiwan to Japan
* This means China can't say "it's the West that sucks" -- it's them!

* Time to modernize. They look to Japan because it's easier to look there than, say, Europe

* In late 1800s, they're now debating HOW to change
* The essence of who we are might or might not change if we adopt Western tools
* China is like a big, old mansion that's falling apart

* Qing dynasty falls in "October Revolution" of 1911, putting the Hans in charge and kicking the Manchus out
* Opens the floodgates for modernization

* For 38 years, progress is halted and there's no real central authority because local warlords are kings

* Communists vs. capitalists (aka nationalists) in 1920

* You had to be educated to be in the government
* Education was a lot of memorizing and testing and it was crazy
* You had to be rich to be educated, pretty much
