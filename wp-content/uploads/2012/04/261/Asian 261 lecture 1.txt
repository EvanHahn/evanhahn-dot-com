Fiction was a key component of modern culture in China (but not so much elsewhere), so we'll look at that a lot

Quizzes will be easy; you either know them or you don't

* Qing Dynasty (1644 - 1911) was overthrown
* Intellectuals were like "shiiit, 80% - 90% of us are illiterate, we might be overthrown by the west or Japan"
* They decided to use fiction -- it'd create a new kind of citizen
* There was an "explosion" of individualism -- they were trying to create characters that were relatable, and also make traditional values look dated (in the 1920s)
* They were influenced by Western culture -- "a model for what Chinese culture should aspire to"
* By the 1930s, Marxism and communism is the dominant thing -- fiction doesn't have just one hero, not one individual
* In 1942, Mao says "hey you gotta make this serve the communists if you're writing or making any art" and it becomes law
* In the 70s, after Mao dies, guy is like "yeah man write what you want go for it"

* Some history
  * 2205 B.C. to 1766 B.C. = a dynasty
  * 1766 B.C. to 1122 B.C. = a dynasty
  * 1276 A.D. to 1368 A.D. = Mongols, when Beijing became the capital, took over by violence

* China's traditional/internal/domestic problems
  * Manchu/Qing dynasty took over from the north 1644-1911
    * Manchurians could kill Han people; Han were slaves
    * But Manchus assimilated into Chinese culture, so the Han "won"
  * Han-Chinese-run bureaucracy
    * Han = racial, ethnic, linguistic, cultural polity
    * Most people in China are called Han
  * You take exams to rule the country; emperors were playboys
  * People realized that dynasties were keeping China from advancing -- this was how China got into the modern world (this was in the 1800s)
  * Chinese people were like "we're superior suck our dicks" -- other nations were tributary nations
  * British trade
    * British people loved tea but they were spending a ton of money and China wasn't buying anything from them.
    * British people were like "OPIUM ALL UP IN THIS MOTHERFUCKER" and they made a lot of profit and got people addicted
    * Qing people were pissed because they were giving them tea (which is fine) and British people were like "FUCK YEAH, RUIN YOUR LIFE WITH OPIUM, HAHAHA", so some Han dude arrests them and destroys all their opium (but only after saying "hey, please stop" in a letter)
    * British come in with their military and start an opium war and Britain basically destroys them
    * By 1942, they have to sign a treaty for trade and Christian missionaries and Britain gets Hong Kong
    * China is like "what how", "we are being cut up like a melon" is what intellectuals said
  * Education (and therefore access to power) was inaccessible
