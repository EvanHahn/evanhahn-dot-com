- Two main things that are divided
    - Marxian theory/method = criticism
    - Marxist doctrine/dogma = solution (?)

- Marxian theory
    - Base/superstructure
    - Economy (not just buy/sell, but production too)

- Urban, educated intellectual
- Common-people
- Dialectic = thesis and synthesis. Critical process. You take something, you negate it, and then you negate that and it moves forward. Theory vs. practice.
- Political philosophies
    - Reactionary: reverse change!
    - Conservative: no change!
    - Progressive (reformist/revolutionary): change!
