- Land collectivization

    - Types
        - Mutual-aid teams: 4-10 households pooled their labor. They kept their private property
        - Lower-level agricultural producers' cooperatives (APC): 20-40 households. No private property. You get "work points" which determines how much you make
        - Higher-level APCs: 100-300 households pooled and mutually owned all resources.

    - GLF problems
        - Fatigue
        - Lack of scientific expertise
        - Natural disasters
        - Falsified agricultural quotas
        - Overtaxation of grain based on falsified quotes
        - Lack of communication and trust among competing pragmatists; pragmatists wouldn't speak out
        - Destruction of a multitude of daily necessary metal and wood utensils

    - These are pushed onto people
    - Communes move to barracks together
    - In theory, this frees up labor. Mao wanted to make steel. People's shit was taken to make steel and it didn't even work
    - In practice, people resist. People don't work hard in some cases. Experts looked down upon
    - People got more food and health/mortality rates did go up
    - Fatigue. Too much enthusiasm caused lots of issues.
    - People begin to starve because there were faulty expectations. 45 million people die (Chinese government says 30 million, which is still really high)
