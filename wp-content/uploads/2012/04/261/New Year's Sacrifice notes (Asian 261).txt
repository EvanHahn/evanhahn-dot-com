Big picture: This story shows how bad traditional China is and how difficult it is to have agency in your life, ESPECIALLY for women. A woman is sacrificed and everyone seems to feel better.

- Narrator is a May Fourth intellectual

- "New Year's Eve of the old calendar weeks after all more like the real New Year's Eve" -- note that he says that the old calendar isn't real

- There is a sacrifice of animals in Luchen for the new year's good fortune. Only men

- Narrator stayed with his "fourth uncle" who was a student of the imperial school

- Met Hsiang Lin's wife who had become a beggar and was ruined
- She asked him if there were ghosts, if there was a hell, and will dead people see each other again?
- He is struck, worried that his answer might cause some harm, but then says "I'm not sure" and frees himself from whatever might happen
- "'I am not sure' is a most useful phrase."

- He still feels worried and then that woman dies "of poverty"

- Because "something I had felt imminent had already taken place," he was no longer concerned

- He wanted to ask his uncle about ghosts but didn't

- It's time for narrator to leave

- He feels bad for the woman: "in the present world when a meaningless existence ends, so that someone whom others are tired of seeing is no longer seen, it is just as well, both for the individual concerned and for others."
- She had a "severe" mother-in-law
- She was a servant for some time
- He reflects that nobody said her name and that she was quiet and kinda mysterious
- She got married off after much resistance (and got a knock in her head) and then her whole family died

- She came back and told a sad story of how her child was eaten by wolves when she was chopping wood
- The story was sad but eventually people knew it by heart and it was "stale"

- People made fun of her because she resisted but eventually gave in

- Shows a negative view of traditional Chinese culture

- Old Miss Wei was "kind of like a matchmaker"

- Hsiang Lin's wife was made a slave in the family

- In the end, she's unclean because she's divorced and her husbands died and so did son, so it's bad luck

- Hsiang Lin's wife wants to be a person but she's not recognized as one

- Lu Xun basically is saying that, in traditional Chinese culture, it's really hard to have agency, especially for women

- Women are doing all the work, only men can do worship, etc.

- The village is supposed to represent all of China

- The woman asks the narrator about the afterlife. He has all this learning about his answer but cops out and is chicken. This is ironic. Lu Xun is like, "don't cop out of your learning."
- Lu Xun shows the mind of an intellectual: when someone who's poor and starving, it's better for everyone if she just dies. DARK SHIT BRO
- He's pondering his next meal at a restaurant, which is only something you can do with money

- We talk the talk but we don't walk the walk
- The people who lead movements are often the biggest hypocrites

- Lu Xun makes traditionalists look bad, but also makes the May Fourth people look bad, the peasants make fun of her

- Hsiang Lin's wife IS the New Year's sacrifice
