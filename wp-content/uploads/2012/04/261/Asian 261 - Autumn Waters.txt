## Notes from class

- A man about someone talking about their grandparents and a powerful grandfather
- Good men in the past are killers
- Absence of politics
- Chinese Western, rugged individualism
- Flood is mythological
- Communist era is "flattening of the landscape"

## Notes from reading, for class

- Grandpa dies serenely, people think it's because he did a good job in a past life. "Everybody in our family shared in the glory of my grandfather's death."
- He ran off with a girl in his past, apparently after killing some people and setting fire to a house
- He's hot, she's hot
- They went to a place that wasn't populated and it's now destroyed
- Lots of mosquitos
- There was torrential downpour when grandmother was going to give birth to father, grandfather curses it and it goes away, but his crops were ruined by a flood
- Grandma is worried about getting birth, but grandpa is reassuring
- Grandpa is fishing and catches a mangled corpse and vomits
- Grandma is really weak, wants to be killed rather than have the baby
- Woman comes in the middle of the night from the flood, starts chowing the fuck down
- She's a doctor and, in a threatening way (points a gun at grandfather), helps grandmother have baby boy
- A couple more people show up: girl in white (blind), guy in black
- Blind girl just says nonsense/nothing
- They pass some food around
- "Don't we all possess some special qualities to survive in this world?"
- Man in black kills some rats with a gun, grandfather says he's crazy
- This guy killed the corpse in the river, which was the doctor lady's mom

## Characters

- Grandfather - Killed 3 people, set fire to a house, moved to swampland where his wife had a baby and where his crops were ruined by flood.
- Grandmother - Helped grandfather in crimes, moved with him, had a baby (father).
- Old Seven - Crackshot who was killed by a man in black, who was killed by a purple-wearing doctor lady.

## Notes for me

- "You and I have killed people, we have set fire to a house, so what is left to be afraid of? At the very beginning we said that if we could just spend a single day together, we'd gladly die together; and now how many single days have we passed together? However high a flood, it can't submerge a hill; however high a tree, it can't pierce the sky. You just go ahead and have that baby -- I'm going to take a look at the water."
