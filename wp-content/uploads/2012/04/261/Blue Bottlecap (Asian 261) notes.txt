## Notes from class

* Author is a famous roots-seeking guy, gave the name to the movement
* This story is more radical, experimental
* Roots-seeking characteristics
    * Against melodrama -- take up your agency!
    * Primitivism
    * Rural settings
    * Nostalgia in some stories
    * Nothing is determined
    * What does it mean to write a story?
    * Avant-garde was very weird
* We learn a little about the narrator
* The bottlecap is something missing for everyone (maybe the _objet petit a_?)
* I'm leaving out some of the details and adding some from my imagination. He's not reliable, fact and fiction are mixed together
* He doesn't have the agency that the characters in this literature normally have

## Notes from my reading

* Opening a bottle; Town Elder says "don't talk about bottlecaps" and doesn't say why
* "Name's Chen, Chen Mengtao", who couldn't open the bottlecap and was new
* Knew a lot about people's surnames, was useful in the census
* "Whatever he thought ought to be recorded, he recorded"
* He used to be in a "penal colony" -- jail thingy
* He used to carry rocks but that wasn't for him because he was bad at it and wet the bed
* Then, despite the fact that he was terrified of dead people, he carried dead people
* He built some kind of rope apparatus for carrying corpses and showed it off to the guards
* One day, a corpse fell on him and Chen passed out
* Mengtao = dreaming of peach, so named because of a girl
* He got better at it
* Some guy who had been his friend had fallen behind on some quotas and died. Unused chopsticks symbol
* "He began enthusiastically performing good deeds." Was a little weird.
* People started getting pissed/afraid when he did nice things for them
* It was cold. He popped a bottlecap off some wine and couldn't find the cap. "Just like that, he went insane."

## Characters

* Chen Mengtao - Guy who went crazy in a penal colony after losing a bottlecap

## Notes for me

* "Later and later on a good deal of time went by, a number of people died and were born."
