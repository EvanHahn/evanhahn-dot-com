# Characteristics (copy-pasted from lecture notes)

In Chinese Avant-Garde or experimental writing, we can find many distinct characteristics when compared to previous 20th-century Chinese fiction (of before, during, or after the Mao era):

1. The plot often becomes disjointed or even nonexistent.
2. Intense attention is given to exploring and exploiting the suggestive possibilities of language and of the internal flow and rhythm of the narration itself.
3. Setting, character, and events (to the extent that they could still be recognized) were often no longer specifically ‘Chinese’, or political, or concerned with humanist or communist ideology, history, or any other non-artistic non-literary concern whatsoever.
4. The depoliticization of language.
5. The construction of a new fictional subject, a new [Chinese] identity that doesn’t allegorically stand for the Chinese people, a socio-economic class, humanist individual, etc.
6. Dream, mirage and reality are blurred: the fabulous, fantastic, macabre, and personal mix together indiscriminately.
7. Sadistic urge to dismember/disembowel the human (some critics argue that the human body in these stories often allegorically represents the Maospeak (Mao Wenti, 毛文體) form that the writers are intent on doing violence to.
8. Rebel against humanist, moral, spiritual, historical, and epistemologically centered subjectivity/identity.
9. Impervious to sociopolitical consciousness. They even seem especially eager to shatter the sense of patriotic duty or cultural rescue mission associated with writing Chinese fiction since the time of Lu Xun, and still present in their precursors, the Roots-Seeking, Misty, New Realist, and Wounds/Scars writers.
10. Deliberate subversion of reader expectations.
11. Grotesque -- not necessarily violent -- imagery, as in Can Xue’s work.
12. Psychologically conflicted, neurotic, even psychotic characters and families. However, there is rarely any psychological depth given to these characters, so we witness their symptoms but get little insight into the inner workings of their psyches and their emotional conflicts and family histories.
13. They reject any type of causality, historical, ethical, moral, or otherwise. 
14. Their narratives do not seem to be governed by any rules or traditional/inherited narrative structures, no happy endings here, or even traditionally-recognizable endings/closure/dénouement at all. Nor do they express any notion of progress or linearity. “Labyrinthine plotting, insistent repetition, self-reflexive linguistic conceits, oblique philosophical musings (rarely serious), fragmentary images, unexplained irruptions of the supernatural, the sordid, or the nonsensical” (Jones 558).
