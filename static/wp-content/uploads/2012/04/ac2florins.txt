The florin

From Money and its use in medieval Europe. By Spufford, Peter. Cambridge

* "By 1252 there was enough gold in, or passing through, Genoa and Florence for
these cities to commence striking gold coins of their own. In Genoa the
genovino and in Florence the fiorino d'oro were both struck for the first time
within a few months of one another," (p176).
* "The size of the Florentine florin was dictated instead by the existing
currency system of Tuscany. It was made of enough gold to be worth exactly a
lira, or twenty soldi, in the money of account not only of Florence, but also
of the other leading cities of Tuscany - Pisa, Lucca, and Siena," (p177).
* "3.53 grams against 3.54 grams," (p177). Appendix says it's 3.54.
* "Although ostensibly they were valued for domestic use ... the immediate
international use of both the genovino and the florin underlines the merchant
interests that brough them into being," (p177).
* Looks like there was a Genoan coin (the genovino) which didn't win, but was
very similar.

"The word comes through the Fr. _florin_ from the Ital. _fiorino_, flower, Lat.
_flos_, _florem_. Fiorino was the Italian name of a gold coin issued at
Florence in 1252, weighing about fifty-four grains. This coin bore on the
obverse a lily, from which it took its name of 'the flower,' on the reverse the
Latin name of the city _Florentia_, from which it was also known as a
'florence.' 'Florin' and 'florence' seem to have been used in English
indiscriminately as the name of this coin. The Florentine florin was held in
great commercial repute throughout Europe, and similar coins were struck in
Germany, other parts of Italy, France, &c."

"...Florence's florin, arguably the ancestor of the euro ... before the Medici
were even heard of."

* "The Florentine florin was the first European gold coin to achieve the status
of an international currency after the disappearance of European gold coinage
in the eighth century. Florence first issued the florin in 1252. It weighed
3.53 grams or 72 grains of fine gold and tooks its name from the fleur-de-lis,
the iris flower whose image adorned one side of the florin."
* "The florin preceded the era of milled coins with corrugated edges that
protected coins against the clippers. To circumvent the clippers, florins
circulated in leather bags sealed by the mint. The seal was intended to vouch
for the integrity of the coins inside." Info on coin clipping:

* "...equal to 20 _soldi_ or shillings, or 240 _deniers_, or pennies. The
Florentine version of the Carolingian system soon broke down amid fluctuating
exchange rates between gold and silver, and an imaginary money of account
developed based on a pound _affiorino_, in which 20 florins equaled 29
affiorinos. A separate silver standard evolved that set the value of the silver
pound equal to 20 silver soldi, or 240 silver deniers. Market forces overrode
government efforts to establish official exchange ratios between gold and
silver"
* "From 1252 until the beginning of the 15th century, the florin rose in value
700 percent relative to silver coinage, largely reflecting debasement of
silver."
* "During the 15th century, the Venetian _ducat_ displaced the Florentine
florin as the international currency par excellence."

* "The coin's obverse bore the coat of arms of Florence, a lily flower. The
reverse depicted the Florentine city saint John the Baptist. After the image of
the lily flower, the coin was called fiorino d'oro (from Latin flos = flower,
and oro = gold)."
* "The fiorino d'oro of the Republic of Florence was the first gold coin in
Middle and Western Europe to play a significant commercial role since about 500
years. At that time, gold was used only in Southern Italy, Sicily and Spain,
which were under Arabic influence. However, the increase of trade with the
Levant that went along with the crusades eventually brought enough gold to
Florence to instigate gold coinage -- first in Italy, and later all over
Europe."
* "The fiorino d'oro was struck from 1252 to 1523 with no major change in
design or metal content standard. The weight was chosen to equal the value of
one silver lira (i.e. a nominal pound of 240 inflated denarii) in the local
money of account of the mid-13th century. But while the gold content of the
fiorino did not change over the centuries, the money of account continued to
inflate. As a result a fiorino d'oro was worth seven Florentine lire by 1500."
