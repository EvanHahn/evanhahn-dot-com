* He wants love
* He had gone through many schools
* He went to another city for beautiful women

* While Yu Dafu was a Chinese student in Japan, he wrote a story about a Chinese student in Japan

* Some people felt that you wrote fiction because we need to change the world: art for life's sake

* This is the last really private, personal writing for awhile

* Very Wertherian

* The narrator is a May Fourth, young intellectual

* He knows that he's alienating people because of his behavior

* We adopt patriotism when we're sexually frustrated, or it's a parallel to our inner conflicts

* Lyrical, not epic

* Lots of italics

* He never follows through on his own promises
