- People in CCP are becoming elite; bureaucrat-ism
- Mao is like, "come tell us what's wrong with the new China, writers". Constructive criticism is something he would prefer to see. People are terrified to say anything. "Let a hundred flowers bloom: let a hundred schools of thought contend."

- From May to June of 1957, there's a flood of of intellectuals criticizing fucking everything

- Mao gets pissed (the fuck?). Terminates the 100 Flowers Movement in July of 1957. Starts Anti-Rightist Campaign.

- Mao calls these intellectuals traitors, rightists, "poisonous weeds."

- Silenced pretty much any dissent

- Mao claimed to have planned the entire thing
