Notes from my reading
- Uncle Huai was the only person left responsible for the production brigade
- Huai = "steady, conscientious person with strength". He's a boss
- Grandpa Stonemason was sick but he was probably with a good doctor so it was k, MAYBE
- "'If we'd had a doctor in our brigade ... the influenza epidemic would have been'" beaten quick
- Chairman Mao had a quote: "In medical and health work, put the stress on the rural areas."
- Hung-yu (16) wants to become a barefoot doctor. He's chiseling rock
- Young Wang = courier
- Hung-yu convinces Uncle Huai that he can go study to be a barefoot doctor
- People are concerned about putting such responsibility on a guy who's only 16
- "'We mustn't underestimate our young people'"
- Huai convinces brigade leader pretty much the same way Hung-yu convinced Huai
- Lame Sun was "backward ideologically" but wants to be a barefoot doctor. People think he's in it for selfish reasons, and doesn't actually want to serve peasants even if he's skilled
- Hung-yu gave something to Grandpa and he got sick all night. Grandpa still has faith
- Huai cured some guy in the past
- Grandpa cures him
