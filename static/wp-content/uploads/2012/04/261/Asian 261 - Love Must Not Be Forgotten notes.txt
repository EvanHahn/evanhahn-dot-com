Notes from class

- 1979: right after Mao dies
- This stuff is "scars and wounds literature": you can write openly about the cultural revolution
- Talks about Greeks
- The guy is the "good class DNA" but he's coded as an idiot in this story
- Attachment to literature that mother has for private, personal reasons
- Really good at "rejecting" Mao-era stuff

From my reading

- Woman (Shanshan?) is 30, "same age as our People's Republic"
- Suitor: Qiao Lin, who she compared to Greek sexyboy, but he's dull. Only says "good" or "bad."
- She's conflicted about marrying him; no love but maybe it's what is best from society. Mom says no
- Mom is her bestie
- Mom got married to man she didn't love
- Mom had Chekov books from her lover and didn't want daughter to take hers
- Mom seemed in love with her diary because she talked to it like her lover
- Mom with icy trembling handshake, so did man. She worshipped him
- He gave her Chekov, his version of a love letter. He didn't believe in love but had it
- They loved each other but avoided each other but do nothing. Then he dies (in Cultural Revolution)
- He's a big player in Cultural Revolution and so is she
- Mom wishes there was a heaven even though she doesn't believe in one
- Society may hate you for not getting married but you'll hate it if there's no love
