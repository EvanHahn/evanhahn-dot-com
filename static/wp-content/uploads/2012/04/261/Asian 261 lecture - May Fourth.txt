# In short #

* They want to abolish traditionalism; it's holding us back
* May Fourth Movement kinda starts the movement to modernization

# In detail #

* In short: we gotta change or we're dead.
    * They divide their problems into two: (1) problems from outside (2) internal problems with traditional China
    * If the culture (literature) doesn't change, we're dead
    * Intellectuals studied in western(ized) areas
    * In 1905, intellectuals abolished civil service exams, tried to modernize all education (foreign language, engineering, philosophy, sociology, science, math, military) and it was open to more people (though not all)
    * Lots of foreign literature was translated. Kirk Denton: "Perhaps the defining feature of Chinese cultural modernity is its preoccupation with Western knowledge."
    * Cultural shift was radical

* People aren't educated so they can't get this
* Hundreds of journals are started; good intellectual platform ("New Youth" journal is started in 1915 -- a deliberate stab at tradition)
* Chinese think it's good to be old; Westerners think it's good to be young
* "Call to Youth" - Be independent, be progressive, be aggressive, be posmopolitan, be utilitarian, be scientific

* How did the May Fourth Movement come to be?
    * Warlords are controlling parts of China and want to take over much/all of China
    * Around this time, West is involved with World War I. China gets involved late, on the winning side. Wins, and at the Treaty of Versailles (1919), big warlord decides to give a once-German penninsula to the Japanese
    * Young students and others are like "wtf, why don't we get anything, this is awful" -- "giving away another piece of the melon"
    * This leads to students protesting on May 4th in Tiannamen Square; protested some people, burned down some houses, doesn't lead to political revolution but DOES mark an awakening of the Chinese people to the modern era
    * Everything after this is the "May Fourth movement"

* May Fourth Movement
    * Traditionalists had to debate the young people's stuff
    * Anti-traditionalism, elightenment
        * They wanted to make the language more colloquial/vernacular so that it's more intelligible
        * Less sexism (some say this is just to help their argument)
        * No Confucianism
        * Importing Western ideas
        * No more superstition
        * Education for everyone
    * Anti-imperialism, national salvation
    * Literature's two modes
        * Wertherian - Passive; inner struggle
        * Promethian - He looked at his environment, saw obstacles, and SEIZED THE DAY; thought before action in some cases but not all

* How did communism take over?
    * By the mid-1920s, there's too much individualism
    * By early 1930s, Marxism has become a widely-read philosophy
    * In 1932, Japanese people wanted to colonize China
    * Communist party forms very soon after this -- they don't like the imperialism of other places, it's a critique of those who are being bad to us
    * There's an existing structure in Confucianism which lines up with Marxism
